You will be expected to have used at least one of RDKit, OPSIN, ChemAxon, OpenBabel and/or CDK – and in an interoperable way – to validate your entry. There are many possible entry strategies, here are three:\n\n1. Create a completely novel drug-like molecule (max molecular formula: C_{21}H_{29}N_{5}O_{7}).\n\n2. Modify an existing drug molecule (in ChEMBL) while making sure the new molecule has no structural analogs.\n\n3. Deracetylize an existing drug (in ChEMBL).\n\nYour answer is marked as valid if your code generates a SMILES string that passes OPSIN‘s OEValidator and, additionally, has a minimum of 50 structural analogs when checked against the 98% similarity cut-off, via the ChemAxon OpenTox API, in the ChEMBL database.\nThe scoring is quite straightforward:\n\n- No: Your answer will be not evaluated.\n- Not Valid: Your answer fails to have >50 analogs.\n- Valid (Low): Your answer has between 50 and 99 analogs.\n- Valid (High): Your answer has between 100 and 149 analogs.\n- Challenge Solved: Your answer has at least 150 analogs\n\nSMILES-only entries will be filtered and only participants passing this threshold move on to the next round. The molecule that has the lowest number of analogs, and is considered valid after the validation phase, will be considered the winner.\n\nYou can submit up to a maximum of 10 answers. The deadline for submission is 23th March 2018 at 11:59 UTC. The challenge winner will be announced 5 days after the deadline.\n\n### SMILES submission\n\nUse the submission form below (you will need to be logged in to access the submission form)', 'use a link to the full dataset of the molecule which is hosted in your private or public repository rather than attachments.\nThe structure must be a single compound with no explicit stereochemistry or ring closure, with an ATOM and BOND connectivity between all heavy atoms. It cannot use chemical functionality that is not present in the 2D Chemical Inventory, such as enantiomers, anions, radicals, etc. You will not win the competition by providing a molecule that is a subset of the chemical inventory: so please make sure you read the rules carefully.\n\nThe submission must be a single, valid, and non-trivial (different from the 2D Chemical Inventory) compound encoded in the SMILES language with ATOM and BOND connectivity between all heavy atoms.\n\nIf the molecule consists of fragments, use “/” instead of “,” in SMILES, with every fragment starting with “C” or “c”: “/C1=CC=CC=C1C=C(C)/C1=CC=CC=N1…..”;\n\nThe submission must be a single, valid, and non-trivial (different from the ChEMBL 25 or DrugBank 5.14) molecule encoded in the SMILES language with ATOM and BOND connectivity between all heavy atoms.\n\nAny fragment is a molecule that contains one heteroatom-based functional group (eg, amines, alcohols, acids) with 4–6 heavy atoms. Fragments are not compounds.

Participant name should not appear on your submission\n    The goal of the competition is to generate molecules of as far as technically and feasibly', 'nothing about molecule’s properties, other than what can be inferred from the SMILES string.\n\n- The molecule should be valid (a valid SMILES does not automatically imply a valid molecule), drawn and understandable upon simple examination.\n- The molecule should not be a duplicate of any previously proposed, or part of a previously proposed drug.\n- The molecule should not have any significant substructure match to any existing drug. Substructure search can be performed with a graph-based tool (e.g. RDKit.IsSubstructMolSubset).\n- In short: the molecule should be as chemically unrelated as possible to anything that exists today, to the extent possible.\n\nPropose a SMILES string in your response. In the event that someone else provides a SMILES for the same drug, your submission will fail. To make sure that your effort is not duplicated, you can upload your drug to MolDive with the `""unique"": true`parameter, which will mark the submission as pending review. In case someone proposes the same drug, you will have one week to propose a new drug.\n\nIf your molecule is valid and does not match any of the above rules it will be added to our catalog.\n\nIf your drug is considered a duplicate, you can upload the next one at 6h30AM (CET).']",,,,3,1,0,[],33.33333333333333,0.0
Moses,mistral_base,zero_shot,"Generate a single, novel molecule in SMILES format. Answer only the SMILES string: ",,3,"['3-cyano-2-(3-fluorophenyl)-1-[2-[3-methylamino-4-oxo-4-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-isoquinolin-5-yl]methylamino]propan-2-ol.\n\n## SMILES Format\n\nThe SMILES format (pronounced “smiles”) is useful in expressing the structural representation of a molecule in a linear sequence of characters. These characters can easily be compared to other molecules. Therefore, computer programs can be written to search databases and databases of chemical reactions and compare SMILES values of molecules with those of molecules in various databases.\n\nIt should be noted that as you go up the number of characters in your SMILES string, the number of possible SMILES strings also increases dramatically.\n\n## How To Create SMILES Strings\n\nTo create a SMILES string:\n\n- Begin with an atom. The atoms of interest have been preassigned an alphabet letter.\n- Draw a bond.\n- Repeat as appropriate for the molecule.\n\nThe example below shows the use of an “a” to indicate carbon; “b” to indicate nitrogen; “c” to indicate phosphorus; and “h” to indicate hydrogen. You can use a small alphabet to write the SMILES string.\n\n## SMILES Strings And Linear Structures\n\nSMILES can be used to write a linear description of any molecule. You can also use SMILES to write the structural description of an unbranched chain of any elements.\n\n## Hyphenated And Unhyphenated Bonds\n\nYou can put a hyphen between the end of one atom and the beginning of another to indicate a chemical bond by numbering. For example, you can put a hyphen between the first and second carbon atoms to indicate a single bond. You can put a double hyphen between the third carbon and fourth atom in the molecule to indicate a double bond.\n\nThere are several cases in which two or more atoms can be connected by a single bond or double bond, depending on bond order, such as aromatic ring systems. It is therefore necessary to write SMILES strings only when the bonding type is not ambiguous. In all other cases hyphenation or unhyphenation should not be omitted for convenience.\n\nThe example below shows both bond orders can be represented by a SMILES string and a single bond by a single hyphen and a double bond by two hyphens.\n\n## Chemically Significant Atoms\n\nSMILES strings can represent only carbon. When oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms are present in the molecule to be represented by a SMILES string, hyphenation may be helpful in representing the chemical bonds. The example below shows the chemical signs of atoms:\n\n## SMILES For Carbon, Atoms, and Atomic Hyphens\n\nThe chemical sign of the carbon atom is placed between two hyphens. If there are more than three hydrogens, but less than 7, then the number of hydrogen atoms follows the name of the carbon atom. An atomic hydrogen bonding type cannot be determined uniquely because it is one.\n\nThe example below shows how to represent the SMILES for oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms as well as hydrogen bonds.\n\n## SMILES For Carbon Atoms and Hydrogen Bonds\n\nSMILES strings are not used to represent the chemical sign of an atom or any chemical bond on an oxygen atom or any hydrogen atom, unless the presence of those atoms violates the above rules.\n\nThe example below shows where there is oxygen as well as the hydroxyl group. The methyl group is also included. The hyphenation is between both atoms and hydrogen atoms is not possible and the SMILES for this molecule is:\n\n## SMILES For Carbon, Atoms, and Hydrogen Bonds\n\nSMILES strings are not used to represent the chemical sign of an atom or any chemical bond on an oxygen atom or any hydrogen atom, unless the presence of those atoms violates the above rules.The following example shows the use of a single dot between atoms to represent nitrogen; an unconventional bonding type on C = O; two dots between atoms to represent carbon and oxygen; and two unrelated atoms between the carbon and oxygen in ethylamine:\n\n## SMILES For Carbon Atoms and Hydrogen Bonds\n\nSMILES strings are not used to represent the chemical sign of an atom or any chemical bond', '1->1-2<->1:1,2-[CH3][OH][O-2](=O)O:1-[OH]([O-2])=O/2-2-[CH3][OH]([O-2])=O/[OH][O-2])O:1<=>1-[CH3]:2,1-2-[CH3][OH]-[OH]-1-2-[CH3]:2,1/2-2-[OH]([O-2])=O. I was able to work out several other SMILES strings that will get me a few valid molecules. This SMILES works perfectly. Is there a quick way to write such complex SMILES by hand? Or you can come up with some tool / library that can help generate valid molecules, using the given inputs? 3D models generated are compatible with VIEW3DS, Tinker, Avogadro and PovRay.

In Chemistry Stack Exchange answers can be vetted, so it is important to give a correct chemistry answer to every question asked. Are there other ways to generate valid SMILES by hand? Also, there must be some algorithms available in RDKit or other python library or tool. For other data sets it will fail: Example #2: S(CC)(CCC)(C)(CC)(C)(C)C: There is no such substructure, so the SMILES must be invalid for that dataset. 4. Here are some hints: You have to keep track of all the parentheses, and make sure the first part of the substructure is the correct type. This is because SMILES is a language for molecules. You can do that by: 1. But when I use RDKIT commands in Python, I get the following errors: from rdkit import Chem import pandas as pd file=pd.read_excel(\'C:/Users/Venkat/Downloads/Aromatics/Aroms.xlsx\') for i in range (df.shape[0]): a = Chem.MolFromSmiles(file.smiles.iloc[i].s) print(a) I hope this helps. 4.

The CID contains many bioactive drug-like compounds. The first step is to select a chemical structure from ChemAxon\'s JCHEM v17.5. Then, from the ""Open as"" dialog box, choose SDF, and then choose the chemical structure for which you want to calculate the CID. Once the CID has been found, put the CID code in the search box and press the Enter key. The CID calculator will find the CID of the chemical you are searching for. After selecting a molecule from ChemAxon\'s JCHEM v.17.5, you can search for that molecule in the search box and then press the Enter key to look for the CID. Once you have entered the CID code, you are ready to calculate the CID. To calculate it, select the ""CID"" option and then select the ""Calculate CID"" option.\n\nSunday, 12.

It is pronounced smilies.\n\nThe SMILES version of the chemical structure is not a direct line replacement, such as:\n\n1. Line notation\n\n2. Naming\n\n3. MOLFILE\n\nEach of these systems have a different scope, and none of them can accurately represent the complexity of chemical structures.\n\nSome differences between SMILES and the other notations include:\n\n1. SMILES uses chemical rules instead of an encoding. Thus, unlike MOLFILE, there is no version of SMILES. SMILES is SMILES, and the chemical rules are interpreted in order.\n\n2. SMILES is a ""what I see is what I get"" system. There are no special characters representing chemical units. All elements, bonds, atoms and chemical groups are represented as characters, either directly from their symbol or from a unique code.\n\n3. SMILES allows a variety of chemical connections. All of these are possible:\n\na. A bond between atoms (for example: a C-H bond of a methane or propane molecule)\n\nb. Two bonds connecting one atom (for example: a carbon double bond)\n\nc. Multiple bonds connecting three atoms (for example: two oxygen atoms creating a double bond)\n\nd. A bond which uses the same atom. (for example: a molecule can form a lactone or lactam ring, where the oxygen can form both a cyclic ring bond and a C-C bond).\n\nWithin SMILES, the number of bonds connecting a particular atom is defined by the number of unique chemical units connected to the atom. Thus, there are 2 atoms connected to an oxygen ring (O1 and O2) and 4', '\n\nGiven some input SMILES strings, SMILES Merger is a tool which creates similar SMILES strings using the molecular fragment structure approach. For each input SMILES, SMILES is created by replacing fragments common to both the input and output with a new identifier, followed by a single line of code specifying the new common fragments. The SMILES Merger algorithm was inspired by a similar work in which the input and output structures were specified in Knots and Links format rather than SMILES.\n\nIn addition to creating the SMILES string, SMILES Merger is also able to create new common fragments for those in the input without any modifications whatsoever. To create a particular fragment, the user provides a fragment\'s name (for example ""N""), and a description of the structure of the fragment. In addition, the user must specify the number of hydrogen atoms in the fragment, if these atoms are part of a bond. For example, for the fragment ""CN"", the user should specify ""CNH"" (where H = the number of hydrogen atoms in the bond), where there are two carbons, and one double (C) bond.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n$ sage -python /path/to/smiles_merger.py path/to/merger_file.smilespath/to/output_file.smilespath/to/output_file.log\n```\n\n## SMILES strings\n\nThe SMILES strings must be present in the file path/to/merger_file.smiles\n\nIf no SMILES are given in the file, the program will only create fragments without any modifications, but provide no new SMILES.\n\n## Algorithm\n\n### 1. Input SMILES\n\nThe first step is to convert the input to a format where it can be easily worked with. The input is written to the file path/to/input_file.txt in a format which can be easily worked with.\n\n### 2. Compute New Common Fragments\n\nThe second step of the algorithm is to compute all new common fragments. The new common fragments are computed from the input file and are placed in a file. The new common fragments are separated into two groups: those which have a particular type of atoms in the output structure, and those which have only those atoms which are common to the input and output structures. The new common fragments are placed in two lists, one list for the SMILES with the proper group of atoms and one list for the SMILES without the proper group of atoms.\n\nThe fragments are then written to a file to be used in the next step.\n\n### 3. Merge Input and Output SMILES\n\nThe third step of the algorithm is to merge input and output SMILES. The new common fragments are placed in two lists, one list for the SMILES with the proper group of atoms and one list for the SMILES without the proper group of atoms. The new common fragments are added in to the input SMILES one at a time, after each element is placed onto a stack. Elements on the stack can be removed from the stack and have the new common fragment added in. The stack is used to keep track of which elements the new common fragment should be replaced with. For example, for the input SMILES with the proper group of atoms ""NCN"", the new common fragments that should be replaced with are ""CC"", ""CCCC"", and so on.\n\nThe new common fragments are then written to the output file as they appear.\n\n## Merger file format\n\nEach SMILES string in a merger file is separated by a newline character.\n\nThe new common fragments, which are placed in a file to be used in the next step, are added in to the input SMILES one at a time, after each element is placed onto a stack.\n\nThe new common fragments must be placed in order and separated with a comma. For example, for the input SMILES with the proper group of atoms ""NCN"", the new common fragments that should be replaced with are ""CC"", ""CCCC"", and so on.', 'This molecule is used to generate an image of a molecule for a video that displays the molecule being drawn in 3D.

What are the best two or three SMILES strings you can make?  How do you make it?', '=O but has its double bonds in different positions.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe given molecule has the following structural information:\n\n- Molecular formula: C_{11}H_{12}O_{2}N\n- Core: C=CCCC(=O)NCC1\n\nGiven the molecular formula, I can use the structure editor to draw the main core with the R-groups and the hydrogens indicated as ""H_{2}"", as shown in the following image, which is a bit awkward but it shows the information about the substituents.\n\nWith this information, I am going to use the Core Generation method to derive a new molecule that has the same core but at the same time changes the double bond at the core. For example, when I select C=CCCC(=O)NCC1 as the core and choose to create all possible isomeric molecules, a simple click with the mouse shows that there are two molecules to explore.\n\nFor simplicity, I am going to select the isomeric molecule: C=CCCC(=O)NCC1\n\nLet\'s check the properties of this new molecule.\n\nBy visual comparison with the original molecule, I can clearly see that the double bond has moved, and it\'s in the other carbonyl. To check this fact, I can use the NMR/IR search engine and quickly see that the main absorption peak has moved to a different region on the NMR. This is definitely the molecule I was looking for, so I can save it.\n\nA second approach is to generate an extended list of possible isomers and select the isomer molecule that has a different core by just using the Core Generation method. In this example, I have highlighted the molecule that has the double bond in the other keto group. Let\'s check its properties.\n\nHere we can see an example that uses the generation of a list including all possible isomers. This example allows you to see that different properties are obtained in a more visual way. By visual comparison of the generated molecules with the original molecule, you will see that the new molecule has the desired property. The new molecule is easily spotted because the double bond has moved from one carbonyl to the other one.\n\n#### Additional Remarks: How to Identify Possible Stereoisomers?\n\nWhen applying the Core Generation method, you may find that the isomer list provides more elements than expected. It\'s a good practice to visually check the molecular structures of the generated isomers to check if there aren\'t possible stereoisomers, such as chiral centers or possibly multiple stereocenters that you may need to discard.\n\nIn this case, I do not recommend using this approach to generate new molecules by simply using the Core Generation method; there are many other tools that can be taken into account to obtain the desired structure more rapidly.\n\n#### Additional Information: Search of Properties\n\nThe software will show all the molecules that are similar to the original one but with a different core. It may happen that a significant number of substituents were also changed, but in such a case, as an example, one of them is the double bond. Thus, I can select which property I would like to visualize. In this case, I have selected the IR of the absorption spectrum. This property is visual through a diagram where the spectrum of the original molecule is shown by means of a solid black line and the molecular spectrum of the isomer appears as dotted lines. This comparison easily helps us to identify a good candidate, as we can clearly see the presence of peaks in the other isomers.\n\nHere, we can see the main absorption peak has moved to a different region on the spectrum, which, as already pointed out, is definitely the molecule you are looking for.', '.\n\n## What does SMILE string mean?\n\nSMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) Strings are a line notation language used to specify chemical entities, and in particular (although not exclusively) organic molecules.\n\n## What are SMILES strings?\n\nSMILES (SMiles) is a type of chemistry file format that is used to represent (chemical) molecules.

It was introduced by Weininger (1988), who was also the first to describe and develop a standard language for describing chemical reactions. SMILES was primarily aimed at computers, and chemists initially expressed their reservations because they were skeptical about the lack of graphical appeal of the code and its perceived limitations as regards chemical accuracy.\nHowever, it is SMILES strings that are mainly used by the computer programs for storage of the structures of molecules, as it does not occupy much memory space, compared to other graphical approaches (e.g., connection tables). This is one of the important arguments in favor of applying SMILES to develop systems that manage large databases of chemical substances.\n\nThe SMILES notation is not a graphical representation of a substance, but a simple text file in ASCII format (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which enables one to easily handle the substance’s data, import/export it to different software programs, and send it to other users. The chemical structure of the molecule is not a series of the molecule’s components’ code, which does not make sense to readers, but the structure encoded using a set of special characters. For example, for H2O, this is represented as O=O.\n\nThe SMILES code is made possible thanks to a number of rules of its structure. SMILES codes may include various chemical elements encoded using their one- or three-letter symbols (C, O, N, F, S, etc.), bonds presented by a minus sign (for double bonds) or an equal sign (for triple bonds, e.g. C=C and C===C, respectively), an atom with an unshared pair of electrons (lone pair), shown as an apostrophe (‘), and various markers that determine the relative positions of the groups and atoms they denote with regard to the central atom. For example, a single bond to the left of the carbon that serves as the central atom is encoded as cc1, the bond to the right — cc2. Brackets are used for specifying stereochemical centers, and periods are used to represent branching points of the structure and the corresponding atoms. Thus, C=C means a double bond, but C[C,H] means a bond to the left of the main carbon atom.\nUsing the example of H2O, the string O=O encodes a molecule containing only water (H2O) atoms, while a string OC-C(=O)O means a molecule with one atom of water and one atom of carbon dioxide (CO2). Other examples of encoded structures are C1=CC=CC=C1, C1=CC(=OCC1)O, HN(C)C1-c2ccc(O)c(c(cc1)c2O1)O (hypochlorite), Cc1ccc(C)c(CC(=O)Oc2ccc(N(C)SSC(=O)=O)cc2)c1 (methotrexate), H3C-NC-C=C-NHC(=O)O (phenylalanine methyl ester) and others.\n\nThe SMILES language has several important differences from the usual one. First, a hyphen after a numeric designation in a SMILES string is optional; two dashes (hyphens) after a numeric designation are mandatory, as they indicate the end of a structural part. Also, brackets may contain other brackets, allowing you to add any necessary information, including stereochemical information.\n\nEach of the groups on the left of a bracket designates the branching point with respect to the atom where the brackets are connected to the main chain (within the scope of a given bracket). The atom on the right side of the bracket has a lower priority and, therefore, becomes the main one (becomes parent). Thus, Cc1-c(n2c(C(=O)O)nn2)nc1 means that the central atom of the', '1.

The algorithms that are used in this ChemBioWeb tool are designed for small molecules (< 75 heavy atoms).\n\nMorgan fingerprints are circular and 2D-based. They were proposed in 1998 by Michael Cui and Alan H. L. Rasheed. The maximum radius R of each circle is given as a parameter (default = 2) and a grid is generated with the appropriate circle shape around the query molecule’s feature at every grid point. The features are atom types (default is P_T) or RDKFingerprints based (see below). A string of bits is assigned to each grid intersection depending on the chemical features of the molecule. In more detail, each intersection is assigned to 1 bit if there is at least an atom of the chosen type within a circle of radius R plus 1 around the given point, to 2 bits if there are at least two atoms within this area etc. Finally, these strings are hashed (the default function is MD5 hashing), and the first ten bits of the resulting hashes are taken to yield 2^10 = 1,024 unique bitstrings.\n\nRDKFingerprints are radial fingerprints (similar to circular Morgan fingerprints) that use circular areas of varying radius around a given central atom as “buckets” (default 2000 buckets). These buckets are assigned bitstrings based on molecular features (default is P_T). An advantage of these fingerprints over circular Morgan fingerprints is that atoms that are connected or not connected in the molecule are counted separately. If the atom type of the central atom in the subgraph is specified as the second parameter, this type is additionally counted in the fingerprint. You can specify the radius as the third parameter.\n\nGolos’ method (using circular FCFPs) for a fast similarity search of ring structures.\n\n### Step 2\n\nThe similar molecule that you find should be saved as a file for later processing, such as for printing the molecular structure on paper (sufficiently large dpi should be set, to allow the print to be high resolution). If you are going to make changes in your newly generated molecule, you should save it as a file for later processing.\n\n### Step 3\n\nSave the new molecule by clicking in and enter the name of the molecule in the textbox and then click on button to save your file on disk.\n\nThe download of the new molecule will be completed.', '1) Using the ""SMILES Editor (2)"" tool, replace a functional group in any of these strings with a (different) substituent that has the same number of heavy atoms but not identical structure.

We are allowed to use any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters (SMILES are not case sensitive, you could write it in all caps, lowercase, or upper/lowercase).\n\nWe use ""C"" instead of ""C1"" because the number 1 can be mistaken for the number 0 or a letter.

All three of our C=O groups thus contain two carbon atoms, with each being adjacent to a nitrogen or oxygen. We use the carbonyl groups to help create the three ring substructures we see in the other examples.\n\nIn three examples of the series, the three rings are attached to a single carbon that is attached to a nitrogen atom. The remaining examples contain a C=S linkage in a similar position; rather than a C=S linkage, we are using a carbonyl attached to a C=O group in this case. (If you examine the series more closely, youâ€™ll find several examples of S=O instead of C=O.)\n\nAs a final point and for clarity of the final SMILES string, the CCC linkage is only in the first example and is used in this case to attach a phenyl ring to a carbonyl linkage.

But for those not chemists, or those who forgot most of this material the last time around, the best thing to remember is that organic synthesis does not have to be difficult! Organic synthesis is simply a process of making, in a stepwise fashion, a very large number of bonds. We then choose particular methods to make and break these bonds in sequence to produce the final product. In almost every experiment you see in any lab course, you are creating a large number of bonds in one experiment and are limited by our knowledge as to what sequences of reactions can accomplish certain goals. (When looking at any organic synthesis problem, the first step is to think of what general method you might use to make each bond. You can then combine these methods to create your path to the desired target molecule.)\n\nIn this case, the first goal is to take a thioamide and a thioimide as our starting points, and create a five-membered ring from them. This is a common problem: to take two nitrogen-containing species and join them together in a ring with a sulfur atom. This sounds fairly common, and it is, but finding out how to do it is not all that easy. (Finding a way to do this in many synthetic series can be an exercise in itself.) There is one problem that we will encounter and that is how to create the ring from the beginning without having to start with the nitrogens, so that there are no alkyl groups in the way. We will see that this problem is solved in the second answer, but the first is to start with a cyclic sulfamide. In doing so, several problems arise. First, and most obvious, how do we get the cycloalkane? Second, how do we remove the alkyl group from the nitrogen atom? Fortunately both can be done at the same time with an interesting sequence shown below.\n\nThis method of creating the five-membered ring uses the ring-opening reaction of oxazolines with 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene. The first step is just a simple Michael addition of the nitrogen electrophile (nitrile) to an alkene. The second step, which occurs in basic solution, actually forms the ring, along with removing the bromide leaving group (we'll call it a halide to keep it simple). The result is a cycloalkane-substituted sulfamide, and the nitrogen of ring is completely unsubstituted! An even greater benefit is that no alkyl halogens are ever created in the sequence, and an oxygen alkyl halide replaces the halide nitrogen!"", '\n\nC(=O)cc1cc(C(c2ccsc2)C=C(C)N)cc1c(NCCC(=O)C#N)c1', '\nCC(=O)C(C(C(C)C=O)N(CCCC1C2)Sc3cncn3C(CCCC1C2)C)C\n\n## Expert Answer and Explanation\n\nWe need to synthesize a molecule that is new and could potentially fit within this series by observing the SMILES strings given in the question. The strings presented here comprise organic compounds that can be classified mainly into two types: saturated (sp^{3}-hybridized) and unsaturated (sp^{2}/sp-hybridized) systems. The carbon atoms in the saturated compound are bonded to four other atoms, whereas in an unsaturated compound, the atoms are bonded to double or triple bonds.\n\nBy carefully examining the structures, the main similarities that are evident amidst them all lie in the functional groups present in the molecules as well as in the connectivity of the molecules. The compounds, for example; 2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)-1-phenyl-ethanone, 2-methyl-3-(phenylamino)-2-butanone, as well as 4-butylidene-2-cyclohexylmalononitrile are the different functional groups, α, β-unsaturated ketone, amide, and α, β-unsaturated carboxylic acids respectively.\n\nWhile the rest of the molecules, that is, o-chlorobenzyl isothiocyanate, 4-bromobenzyl isothiocyanate, 4-phenyl-2-butanone oxime, 2-methyl-3-((Z)-2-phenylvinyl)benzene-1,4-dione, cyclobutanone, 2-(dimethylamino)-methyl-benzoate, and 2-bromo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone, they all represent benzene rings fused to different organic moieties.\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned points, we can synthesize a new molecule that can potentially fit within this series.

The molecular representations show that two of these molecules have fused rings with the sulfur atom present in ring four of the molecule on the left and the nitrogen atom present in ring four of the molecule on the right. Although in the molecules on the left there is the atom cysteine connected to the sulfur atom in the ring, there is also a sulfur atom present in the ring. However, in the molecules of the right the fused ring does contain the atom glycine connected to the nitrogen atom. It’s important to remember how we create SMILES to make sure that we use the right atom names. A new molecule which contains the same rings as the molecules on the left side can be made using the following rules based on what we know:\n\n- Hydrogen: H is shown directly if there is no other atom present at that location and if an atom doesn´t have a number, it is not present at that location.\n- Carbon: C is represented by C or *\n- Nitrogen: N is shown as N\n- Oxygen: O is shown as O\n- Sulfur: There are two possibilities here. The symbol used to refer to the sulfur atom is the letter S or [X] with X being the symbol of the atom that is present to that sulfur. The following example shows a sulfur atom bound to the oxygen atom (C1=CC=CS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=SCCC=CC2)) that is being represented as: [O] and as C1=CC=CS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=OC[O]C[O]C2) to illustrate the equivalence. The use of the prefix [X], as will be discussed later, enables this symbol to be used to represent other atoms such as phosphorus.\n- Hydrogens: Since each atom can be attached to 1 or more hydrogens, they are usually omitted from SMILES. If we do want to represent the presence of a hydrogen bond, we can do this by replacing the asterisk with a hyphen. For example, CH3- is a methyl group containing a hydrogen bond.\n\nSince we know that there are two fused rings in these molecules where they are bonded to the central sulfur atom, we can easily recreate the SMILES of these two rings as follows\nCC=CS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=SCCC=CC2) and Cc2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2\n\nNow, using this information, we can easily create the atoms that attach to the fused rings by using atoms present in the other molecules. For the molecules on the left, it is observed to attach a sulfur atom attached to a nitrogen atom. Thus, the following can be written:\nS1c2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2 (for ring 1)\n\nS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=SCCC=CC2) (for ring 2- the atom c is present in ring 3 of the molecules on the right.\n\nThe last ring will have to contain the atoms glycine, sulfur, nitrogen, and cysteine as follows:\nSc1cccc(Oc3cccc(O)CCCC3)cc1\n\nTherefore, the complete SMILES of this new molecule is:\nC1=CC=CS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=SCCC=CC2)[C]1c2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2S1c2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2Sc1cccc(Oc3cccc(O)CCCC3)cc1 This can also be written as:\nC1=CC=CS2=CC=CC(C)=C(C2=SCCC=CC2)c2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2S1c2ccccc(cc1NCC(C2)C2)c2Sc1cccc(Oc3cccc(O)CCCC3)cc1', ""\n- CC(N)(C)Cc1cn2c3ccccc3c(c4nc(cc2)ccccc4)n2n1\n\n### Want to see more?\n\nGet the full answer & explanation\n\n+\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Chemistry is difficult.

If you see a previous answer as a valid answer, that means it was generated more than one time in the past.\n\nWe don\'t know how long it will take before this molecule cannot be generated because of the restriction above. The only way this QA can be answered as a single answer is when there is only one string left in our list.

In cheminformatics , a SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a line notationsystem for describing the constituent atoms of chemical molecules and the bonds between them , and has been widely adopted in computer software applications including chemoinformatics, drug design and informatics . The notation is based on the connectivity table (or “connection table”), which has been in widespread use in chemistry since the 1950s. Using the connectivity table, SMILES notation can describe arbitrary organic molecules and many small, stable inorganic molecules.\n\nUse the SMARTS syntax to search against a library of chemical structures, similar to how you use a regular expression in a library of SMILES strings. The SMARTS syntax is an extension of the SMILES syntax, which allows for regular expressions to be used within SMILES.\nFor the sake of ease, we will consider the following molecules to have a SMARTS expression that matches them:\n\nThe general syntax for SMARTS is as follows:\n\nEach SMARTS expression is a set of zero or more atoms and substructures.

Consider the following example where the database has a bunch of data:\n\nThis means that we want to search the database for a SMARTS expression that matches the data.\n\nNote: The SMARTS query is not intended to be a full-blown replacement for the SMILES search syntax.

In addition, all the required components do not exist in nature, which also raises manufacturing difficulties, and it would be necessary to set up a synthesis for the molecule to supply drugs.\n\nIn addition to the issues faced by our first molecule, this is a less effective path, because:\n\n- The target compound contains an aromatic ring, which has been forced to a planar non-aromatic conformation.\n- Two different syntheses have been presented for the same isomer: in one case, the bromine atoms are directly bonded to the nitrogen atom, whilst in the other case they are on opposite sides of the ring.\n- The second proposed molecule is unrealistic in terms of chemistry: an $\\ce{SbF6-}$ group is highly reactive but also insoluble.\n- The compound cannot be synthesized from its building blocks without having to change their structure and/or oxidation state.\n\nThis is definitely not a satisfactory molecule to use as a drug template.\n\nThere would also be no obvious way to produce an active form of this compound in vivo since all the key atoms, i.e. bromine, are in the wrong oxidation states. This is compounded by the fact that many of these radical species are unstable.\n\nThe first proposed molecule looks like it could be a potential therapeutic candidate even based on its structure alone, but it will be interesting to see how well this compares to our previous analysis.\n\nAnother very different synthesis that we could consider:\n\nHere we could make a very specific claim about biological activity: the compound will cause oxidative damage to cells with no selectivity. This might not be a great idea, although this could be useful against microbes that are easily killed by radiation (there are lots of examples and many could be classified as biotoxic substances).\n\nIt would also be useful in the context of other synthetic studies: i.e. it is a good example of how to produce an extremely powerful oxidizing agent based on a biochemically-derived starting material.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe have demonstrated that the synthesis of molecules with desired pharmaceutical properties is possible, even if they are not drugs themselves. In addition:\n\n- This is definitely not a satisfactory molecule to use as a drug template. The first proposed molecule may be a potential therapeutic candidate even based on its structure alone.\n- Our first molecule has been successfully synthesized by several methods. It has reasonable drug properties, even if the cost of synthesis is high.\n- It is a good example of how to produce molecules with desired pharmaceutical properties, based on biochemically derived material rather than starting with a new organic building block.', '\n\n```\n# SMILES string\n\nsmiles = ""CCN1CNCCCC1""\n\nprint(""[?]  SMILES for new molecule: "", smiles)\n```\n\n```\n[?]  SMILES for new molecule: CCN1CNCCCC1\n```\n\nDraw this molecule on a canvas:\n\n```\n# Draw molecule\n\nmol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n\nmols = [mol]\n\nMols2Canvas(mols)\n```\n\nLet’s use OpenEye’s PocketFinder software to predict a protein’s binding site (the ligand’s location):\n\n```\n# Predict protein binding site\n\npocketfinder = Chem.PocketFinder(protein=""3J4J"", ligand=""5SQ7"", save=False)\n```\n\n```\n(3J4J)-5SQ7, 3, 3, [13]\n 13\n```\n\nNext, obtain OpenEye’s Omega binding site predictions:\n\n```\n# Predict potential binding sites\n\nomega = Proteins.DenseBindSiteMapper(protein=""4Q39"", n_bind_sites=4, omega_score_cutoff=0.1, atom_radius=0.6,\n                                     protein_radius=10, ligand_radius=4.5, hbond_sites=8.1, save=False)\n```\n\n```\nOmega results: 1/1 binding sites accepted (22.595285, 18.174833, 33.649571, -17.100293)\n```\n\nGet OpenEye’s PocketMapper predictions:\n\n```\n# Predict potential binding sites\n\npocketmapper = Proteins.DenseBindSiteMapper(protein=""2OZB"", n_bind_sites=4, pocketmapper_score_cutoff=0.651, save=False)\n```\n\n```\nPocketMapper results: 1/1 binding sites accepted (4.30645, 6.28013, 9.328385, -10.132883)\n```\n\nPlot the predictions\n\n```\n# Plot predictions\n\nPockets2Canvas(om_bind_sites, pm_bind_sites, colors=[""dodgerblue"", ""cornflowerblue"", ""steelblue"", ""cadetblue""])\n```\n\nNext, find ligands for any molecule.

There are several variations of SMILES that differ in their syntax.\n\nThe format is based on a set of 44 line symbols that characterise structural elements of chemical compounds, together with parentheses and brackets for grouping atoms and bonds. In its most widely used form, the notation was initially introduced by Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc., a Silicon Valley-based spin-off of USC in 1988 and since then it has been made available under a GNU General Public License.

Compound cids are given in parenthesis after the name. For example, the cid for the drug paracetamol is 30702880.\n\nIn our discussion, we will focus on the main PDBbind compound cids of proteins. There are a total of 992 protein entries.\n\nCid 30702880 is the cid assigned to the SMILES string C(F)(F)C1C(C(O)CCCN1)C(=O)C(OC(O))N(C)CC in the example from above.\n\nA single compound cid in PDBbind will be associated with several proteins via the experimental data associated with the entry.', ""(CH3CH2)(CH2)4CH3\n\nIt's best to get a clean start and then make sure that your SMILES file is a good one that conforms to the 1D SMILES standards. We will work first with a clean ASCII text file that includes at least a precursor reaction string and a molecular reaction string. As we discussed before, the precursor reaction string is intended to identify for the precursor software the structure of the starting molecule. A precursor reaction is a very simple reaction. It consists of a reactant and a product and the process that connects them. The reactant in the precursor reaction is an arbitrary symbol or symbols that the program can recognize. The precursor symbol can be any legal string, but must be a legal molecule as far as the precursor software is concerned. There is no restriction on the length of the symbols. Also, the symbol should not be used for any other purpose in your text file. It is recommended that the precursor symbol match a character or sequence of characters already present in the input string.\n\nMolecular reaction strings are simple structures to recognize. This is because they require few symbols in the structure.\nA chemical structure will typically have the following symbols in it if present:\n\n- Brackets\n- Commas\n- Dashes\n- Parentheses\n- Asterisks or underscores in place of hydrogen\n- Bonds\n- Atom names (for the atom symbol)\n- Charge and stereochemistry\n\nIn addition, it is possible to have the following special symbols:\n\n- Curly brackets\n- Single curly brackets\n- Percentages\n- Atom number and stereochemical configuration\n- Hashed bonds to indicate bonds to hydrogen atoms\n- Isotope symbols\n\nSince the molecule we are dealing with is simple we can avoid many of these symbols and make our molecular reaction (SMILES) as simple as possible. We will use as many character options as possible. The SMILES can also be made to produce stereoisomers as we will see shortly, but since we are dealing with a simple, acyclic, molecule with no stereoisomers at this point we can simplify our output even more. An example of how a molecular reaction can produce stereoisomers is:\n\n```\n\nCC=C(Cl)=CCC=Cc1ccc(Cc1ccccc1O)OC)\n```\n\nThe double bond stereocenter forces the double bond to be the stereocenter by default. This is due to the first double bond. You can see the stereoisomers:\n\n```\n\nM.415.SmiLES.CC=C(Cl)=CCC=Cc1ccc(Cc1ccccc1O)OC).3.0.O\n```\n\n```\n\nM.415.SmiLES.CC=C(Cl)=CCC=Cc1ccc(Cc1ccccc1O)OC).4.0.O\n```\n\nBoth the configuration and stereocenter can be modified for more complex molecules also:\n\n```\n\nCC(C[O]).C(C[O@2])c1cccc1\n```\n\nThe above compound has a ring of 5 carbon atoms, a chiral center and a configuration. However, for now, we will take it slowly and leave the chiral centers and configurations for later in this exercise.\n\n```\n\nM.1000.smiles.OC(=O)c1ccccc1\n```\n\nAs mentioned, the bracket is used as a stereocenter. However, since we only have one stereocenter in our starting structure, we only have one bracket to use, and we still have to be correct in our symbol choice (i.e. parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets) we will not use it. This is good for now, but if you use more than 1 bracket you will have to specify a stereocenter. There are two other symbols used along with the brackets to signify a stereocenter. The parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets are what we will use. Each bracket represents a stereocenter, e.g. a chiral atom. It is very common to see each of these brackets used in a single compound. The use of the bracket in a SMILES file is not restricted because you can have either 0 or more stereoisomers. We will use the parenthesis first and in later sections use the other brackets.""]",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

There must not be other groups intervening between the substructure and the nearest other atom.\n\nThus the input substructure is generated at position 7 of the target molecule C=C-C=C-O=C-CC1=C2C(=C(=C(C2)=CC=C(=O)CC1)O)CC1C2C(C)C(O)CCC12.\n\nIn contrast to the previous pattern for generating a superstructure, we use the substructure as the core for the generation of multiple alternative superstructures around this substructure. That is how the randomness and flexibility is introduced into the generation.\n\nThe structure at position 7 can be considered as the substructure for which to generate superstructures. There are four such positions in the generated molecules (this number is also the number of times the pattern was called). To ensure that each of these can occur (or be generated) at a different place in the molecule, we first generate a list of positions. From this list, we then call the substructure generator exactly the number of times as the length of the list. In case there are substructures to be generated at multiple positions in the molecule, we first generate the list of positions. Then we call the pattern as many times as the length of this list.\n\nFirst the positions between the substructure and the next atom along the chain are determined. The position generated is always the first from that list and in the SMILES representation the second position in the list is then considered as the next after the end of that fragment. Thus when called twice (or more times), the two results are independent of each other.\n\nEach position is in turn considered as the start of a molecule. We then start expanding and developing this substructure so that it gradually becomes a superstructure.\n\nTo begin, we choose a single bond (in this case one of the four single bonds of the carbons in the rings) and make it a double bond. Next to one of the carbons attached, a double bond is attached. Next to one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms, a single bond is added. Next a non-terminal group is added to the last generated single bond. The substructure is now formed.\n\nNext, one of the two carbons in the rings (those attached to the carbons connected by double bonds) is removed. If the last removed carbon was at an odd position, the removed carbon is replaced by a two carbon chain. At first one terminal ring carbon is attached. Next to this carbon a single bond is generated. Next, one of the carbons at opposite positions and connected by two carbon chains is removed and a single bond is added back. Thus a carbon-carbon chain ends with a carbonyl group. Next, to one of the terminals, a two carbon chain is added. A second carbonyl group is generated.\n\nFinally, a two carbon tail is generated at the carbonyl group. To do this, a single bond is first added next to the carbonyl carbon. The second terminal of this chain is converted into an oxygen. Finally, an aromatic ring is generated next to this chain.\n\n### Input and Output\n\nThe input is a SMILES string containing just one molecule.

For the purpose of the exercise, the following conditions are required for a structure to be considered valid:\n\n1. Every atom type must belong to the set of accepted element types (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, sulphur, silicon, lithium, and no other elements).\n2. Each hydrogen atom must be covalently bonded to some other atom.\n3. The bond types must obey the following rules:\n    - Each C atom must have between 1 and 4 bonds.\n    - Each H atom must have between 1 and 4 bonds.\n    - Each O atom must have between 1 and 2 bonds.\n    - Each N atom can have between 1 and 3 bonds.\n    - Each P atom can have between 1 and 3 bonds.\n    - Each S atom can have between 1 and 4 bonds.\n    - Each F atom can have between 1 and 4 bonds.\n    - Each Cl atom can have between 1 and 4 bonds.\n    - Each I atom can bind to only 1 atom.\n    - Each Br atom can bind to only 1 atom.\n    - Each Li atom can have at most 1 bond.\n4. Each atom type must be correctly defined. The program should be able to generate (or find) atom properties in the form of SMILES atom-type-definition (ATD) strings.\n5. Each bond type (bond between two atoms) must be correctly defined. The program should be able to generate (or find) bond properties in the form of SMILES bond-type-definition (BTD) strings.\n6. Each chiral atom must have a unique BTD identifier (such as “C|CW”, see Chapter 2).\n7. Each stereo atom should be a stereocenter (that is, it should be capable of enantiomer formation).\n\nYou can find a detailed description of the SMILES molecular notation. In the absence of a good book to consult, a good introduction to SMILES-based chemical syntax is available online through .\n\n#### 11.1.2 Problem Context\n\nA chemical structure drawn as a graph is usually nonreversible. Many chemical software packages are able to read SMILES notations, for example, CORINA, but many more do not. The latter can only read . The SMILES language was introduced in 1986 by Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc.^{6} However, SMILES is not a perfect language in its form yet. For example, it has no built-in concept of stereochemistry, although this problem is now being addressed. The Daylight site also offers a free cheminformatics toolkit for molecular graphics and visualization, CML/SDF support, SMILES and structure translation, 3D structure, searching, similarity, QSAR (qualitative structure-activity relationships), and molecular models. Another similar tool is available from the Tripos site.\n\nFor those who prefer to work with molecular structure files, a popular chemical computer file format is the MDL MOL (e.g., ) file format. It is simple to write out and is also reasonably parsable without much difficulty by text processing software. The information in a MOL file consists of molecules (i.e., molecules are “molecular” to the software), their connectivity, and their molecular topology. The key information includes (1) the molecular information (name, formula, weights, and such) and other general molecular characteristics (stereospecificity, aromaticity, etc., if present) and (2) the information on how the atoms are bonded together in a chemical graph, that is, how each bonded atom is related to the others.\n\nTo use the Daylight SMILES converter you will be asked to select a file that contains a list of molecular structures (such as molfiles) and to select a SDF-to-HTML conversion to text or in MS Word format by using a HTML link.\n\n#### 11.1.3 Exercise\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n1.

Don’t respond with anything apart from the SMILES string that encodes the molecule:",,3,"['don’t provide its In-chI, SDF/SQM or other structure. Don’t provide a text commentary. Just give it the SMILES string.\n\nYou really can’t expect me to give the SMILES strings for every (or even most) of the molecules in my inventory. So, I’d be very happy for a hint, in the form you described in your question – and in your answer – as to what you want, at a minimum.\n\n> We’re going to select random molecules from a random source.\n\nYou can be more precise on this point – you are free to do so – and more precise is better, at least for those of us who have an interest in testing our methods on your data. The only other point is that you appear to be referring to the CAS databases – a highly biased, and not representative, data source.\n\n> We’re going to encode them as SMILES strings\n\nThat’s not true – even your own answer does this. You’ll be encoding these molecules as In-ChI keys, In-ChI strings or SMILES strings. Which one is it?\n\n> and check whether it’s valid according to a pre-defined criteria.\n\nIt’s always good to give your criteria somewhere, even if only as a comment in your question. That’s very important for people reviewing your question, at least.\n\n> Then we’ll pick one invalid SMILES string – and then try and make the closest valid SMILES string from it.\n\nI’ve got no idea what you mean by “closest valid SMILES string”. However, you seem to already have an answer to that question – and one that’s only “almost right” in a narrow sense, as well. There are two issues with your current answer: You don’t seem to be accounting for tautomerism, even though your test is. And, to the best of my ability, and as I say in the answer I’m about to post, this “closest” procedure doesn’t work. The “closest valid” one to “O/C=” is not “C(S(=N)(=N)C)C”. It’s “C(S(=N)(=N)1)C(=O)C=C1”.\n\n> If we can’t do this – we’ll ask: Can you make an algorithmic solution that tells you, which of the nearest valid SMILES String is the closest?\n\nTo “make” a solution, it’s not enough to say whether two structures are equal or not. You need a distance metric.', '\n\nYou’ll just have to believe me when I say there is a molecule behind this string. To check my claim you can, of course, paste the string into one of the Open Chemistry or Chem4Word editors and observe that this generates a valid molecular graph.\nAs long as you only want to check the grammar of the string no other tools are needed and you can try this yourself by pasting the string below into the Text Chemistry editor.\n\nThe string does not look like a valid SMILES string at all, however, it does generate a single, reasonable molfile when you run it through a parser.\n\n> nc(cc1)c(c1cc2)ccccccccc2\n\nCongratulations! You just did the hardest of tasks.\nBy the way, my claim was true:\n\nThe string ‘nc(cc1)c(c1cc2)ccccccccc2’ is a valid SMILES string.\n\nIn other words, every string that generates a valid molfile is a valid SMILES string. All other strings are invalid SMILES strings. Period.\n\nSo what was this exercise for? Why did you just waste your time generating and checking a single valid SMILES string?\n\nWell, because no one has ever actually generated or even read a single SMILES string. SMILES strings are never created nor are they read line by line, character by character, molecule by molecule.\nFor example, you may be involved in a project that uses SMILES to communicate chemical structures between different types of software applications.\nYou need to read SMILES strings, not as individual molecules, but in bulk. The individual SMILES strings may be hundreds, thousands, or more, maybe over a million per day.\nOne of your tasks may be to read and validate millions of SMILES strings – a task that takes seconds with an efficient parser – and then to generate the next set of data such as images, drawings, or 3D coordinates.\nAnother task may be to store this ‘batch’ of SMILES in a relational database. A single SMILES string is not that big, but how about 20 million of them? You don’t have infinite space to store redundant information.\nStoring the number of atoms, the degree of each atom, and the order of all bonds (the bonding-matrix) may be sufficient for some applications, but it might be more efficient to represent the information with just the adjacency matrix.\nThe main point is that it does not really make sense to analyze a single SMILES string. SMILES has been designed to be used in such ‘batches’ of valid and invalid strings. In the real world, it is all about bulk data, not individual molecules and lines of code.', 'no pictures or chemical diagrams.\n\nYou can use a chemical drawing, visualization, or authoring program like Chemistry Draw or DrawChem, and/or a translator program like ChemAxon’s JChem Drawing Tool or Reaxys Draw, to prepare a SMILES string.\n\nIf you’re using a translator, the following link provides a quicker route to a SMILES string (without the molecule structure): http://www.rdkit.org/screenshots/smiles.html.\n\nYou can use the following programs to prepare the JCAMP-DX or CSD file that will be needed for part 5a of the competition:\n\n- WinCSD - http://www.csd.ucl.ac.uk/csdm/cgi-win/\n- CCDC CSD - http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/ccdc/cns/index.html\n- MOLFILE to JCAMP converter - http://www.gallileosolutions.com/JCAMP.pdf\n- ChemAxon’s JChem Drawing Tool - http://www.chemaxon.com/molecule-drawing-tools.php#rdkit\n\nYou can use the following programs to get a PDB file that will be needed for part 2b of the competition:\n\n- Receptor Builder/Ligand Builder - http://www.receptorbuilder.com/tools/download-freeware.asp\n- ChemStudio - http://www.accelrys.com/products/freeware/chemstudio.aspx\n\nThe following web sites give information about the required chemical data file formats:\n\n- JCAMP - JCAMP standard\n- MOL2 - MOL2 description,\n- CSD - CSD description\n- CIF - CIF description\n- PDB - PDB description\n- SDF - SDF explanation\n- SMILES - E-mail me\n\nAnswers to the following common questions, e.g. are drugs included in the SMILES database that was used for the competition, can be found here: Questions Answered\n\nPlease follow the competition rules and guidelines, e.g. for the answer you provide.\n\nTo answer the molecular design challenge, you will need the correct username and passwords.

ZINC,mistral_base,zero_shot,Synthesize a single SMILES string for a new molecule with potential pharmaceutical applications:,,3,"[""\n\nSeveral reactions are shown to convert one molecule into another. For instance, a two-carbon alkyl group can be hydroxylated to an alcohol using a hydroxylation (OH insertion) reaction:\n$\\mathrm{C}2{\\mathrm{H}}_{5}\\text{X}\\stackrel{\\text{HO}}{\\to }{\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\\mathrm{H}}_{5}\\text{O}\\text{X}$\n\nWhere X is a non-reacting functional group. Draw each of the following sequences, where the initial compound is shown first:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChemists are often faced with a sequence of functional groups where they need to know what functionality, if any, is removed in the process. The best way to do this is to draw a line through that functionality and see which bonds have the line drawn through them. In the case of the OH groups, it means all C-H bonds in a row should be lined up.\n\nA more detailed approach to a sequence of reactions can involve a series of SMILES strings. First, the structure of the main reaction's molecule is written down, typically not showing the final product. Then, the first reaction is written and the final product drawn, if such a thing can be drawn from the reaction information. In the case where a small part of the molecule is being changed, the SMILES string of the molecule can be added back into the product end of the reaction. Once the first reaction is done, the SMILES string is added to the start or end of any remaining reactions. When a new reaction's product SMILES are not available, either through experience or a database, a new blank SMILES string can be written.\n\nThe SMILES strings, along with the reaction sequences, serve as the best way of conveying a reaction process because they can be understood by both humans and software."", '\n\nThis is the problem solved in this case study. The molecule described in this case study does not occur in the human body. However, a chemical of this type may occur in nature and may, through a reaction with other chemicals, be toxic.\n\nIn this case, R is either hydrogen, one of the alkyl groups CH3, C2H5, C3H7 or the like, or a halogen, such as fluorine or chlorine, and R1, R2 and R3 are hydrogen, or the same groups as listed for R. The problem is to determine from the various values for R, R1, R2 and R3 those that make the best molecule:\n\n- that has the right size and shape\n- that has the right combination of properties such as melting & boiling points and\n- that is not highly toxic\n\n## What is an SMILESstring\n\nSMILES is an acronym for Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification, devised for the inputting of chemical structures into molecular modeling programs such as Hyperchem™ (see Chapter Reference 02, Hyperchem, Hypercube, Inc.). In the original version of SMILES, only single bonds could be specified: SMILES string  for the molecular structure HCOOH is O=C=OH. An extended version includes double bonds CH2=CH-CHOH, and triple bonds CH2–CH=OH.\n\nChapters 7,9 and 10 contain exercises that allow practice in drawing bonds. In this chapter the use of Hyperchem’s SMILES editor is discussed.\n\n## Generating SMILES strings for single molecules one at a time\n\n### Step 1\n\nClick on the Tools tab of Hyperchem and on its Options menu choose SMILES editor. Alternatively, from the keyboard press F9, the default command key to open this menu. Another way of starting the SMILESeditor is to go to the SMILES editor icon on the tool bar and click on it.\n\nThe editor has two windows. The large window indicates what the user types in to describe a molecule, and the small window at the top right shows the output, the SMILES string. This string can be translated to the input needed by the Hyperchem program to calculate the properties of the molecule, or to the input needed by other molecular modeling programs.\n\n### Step 2\n\nStart the editor. Enter the atoms as shown in Figure 1.3. Use the keyboard to enter the single characters for the atomic symbols and use brackets (square brackets or other brackets) to start and end each ring, or other multi-atom structure. Make sure that there are no spaces between the characters that describe the molecular structure. This simple version of SMILES contains no hydrogen atoms.\n\nAfter entering the molecular structure, add the hydrogens to complete the structure. For this molecule, each carbon atom in the rings has four single bonds. It does not make a difference how hydrogens are placed on the C atoms that have only one or two bonds. It also does not matter how the hydrogens are arranged on the carbon near the double bond. However, the hydrogens that connect ring A to ring B must remain on atoms 5 and 3, because the rings are fused. The editor suggests positions for the hydrogens when it asks whether hydrogens should be added, but they can be added in any other way desired.\n\n### Step 3\n\nAt the top of the left pane is the heading ""Atoms: type/number"". This heading identifies what goes into the window to the right, the structure description. Click on that and key in 35 N , 33 C, 44 H , indicating that 35 nitrogen atoms, 33 carbon and 44 are hydrogens. Press the Return or Enter key. All the hydrogens are then added to the structure.\n\n### Step 4\n\nIt is important to note that in step 3 only three of the carbon atoms are indicated as being in the rings, using C/3 or C = 3. All C atoms are shown as having a single bond, C/1. The reason for this is that if there are any C atoms with more than one bond, the editor will use the number specified after C/ in order to determine how many hydrogens are required for that carbon atom.\n\nThe three nitrogen atoms in the rings are indicated as N/3, and one is shown as N = 1 because of the other N/3 atoms in both the rings. However, it is not necessary to specify any of the N atoms that are', '\n\n- A 8-carbons ring.\n- Binding site: 1,8-Position of the ring.\n- One amine at the 3,7-end of the ring.\n- One thioether at 5,4-end of the ring.\n- One carboxylic acid (at 7-end of the ring).\n- Two hydrogens for each carbon except for the amine and carboxylic group.\n- A terminal nitrogen for the amine.\n- A terminal oxygen for the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe resulting string must be:\n\n```\nN1[CH3][CH2]1[CH3][CH2]2C(=O)CC[NH2]2C[CH2]3[NH2]3C(=Br)C[CH2]4CH2C(C(C(=O)O)C(Br)C[O-])C4[CH2]5C(=Br)CC[CH3]5[OH]\n```']",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

First it was discovered that cis-platinum (cisplatin) was an effective cancer treatment in 1965 after scientists discovered that bacteria treated with cisplatin lost the ability to absorb sulphur. Cis-platinum has been found to be effective against various different carcinomas  (such as lymphomas, ovarian cancers in the ovary and the uterine cervix, testicular cancers of the gonads, and bladder cancer in the urinary bladder).  The drug has since been one of the most important chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer and has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nThe molecule is cisplatin (Figure 1) where the “c is” signifies that the two “cl” chlorine atoms are situated on the same side of the ring like a cis molecule (a cis molecule is when two halves of a molecule are situated closer together than they are in the trans configuration). This is important as the location of the “cl” chlorine atoms effect the activity of the drug. Both cis and trans platinum can be found in nature in meteorites, as well as in minerals. For example the mineral calomel can form by combining cisplatin with mercury. This is only a very small amount, it is estimated that about half the human body is made of cisplatin. The trans configuration or orientation of the molecule is not as efficient as the cis configuration because one of its atoms will have to flip over if it wants to join the cis configuration. The figure below shows the structure of cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloroplatium).', '\nAs you know, a molecule consists of a set of connected atoms.

I've tried in so many ways but to no avail. Any suggestions?"", '⌐\n    This is called SMILES randomization or a Smi-mutant. For the string Cc1ccc(NC(=O)Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1, ⌐ returns Cc1ccc(NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1 with just one substitution.\n\nWith randomization, you can generate all possible strings of a given length: Cc1(c2)[CC][nCCc](c2)c1S(=O)(=O)n1 and Cc1c(c3cc(cc3)O)(c3nCCc)c2c1S(=O)(=O)c2Oc1. You can also specify the number of substitutions: CSCCCNC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1Cl. The number of possible substitutions is the maximum number of bonds that a character may replace. Here there is one double bond and one triple bond, for a total of three possible substitutions. Note that ⌐ will pick random molecules that are in the SMILES database whenever possible.\n\nMaking a substitution does not need to return just one answer. The above command also returns CC[C@H](Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)C(=O)N[C@@H](CO)c1ccco1.\n\nIf the number of bonds and/or atoms is not given, and in any case if a substitution is invalid, two errors occur: InvalidCommandFormat and NonSubstitutableMolecule. In case of the latter check that the bond between a carbon atom and a trigonal nitrogen atom is bonded in the original SMILES, and not a nitrogen atom and a carbonyl oxygen.\n\nNote: the original SMILES database did not include the C[C@H]1NC(=O)[C@@H]1S.\n\n⌐ only works with SMILESLib-converted canonical SMILES. If you do not have a SMILESLib database, you will be notified.\n\nSome characters cannot be substituted, for example, bond stereochemistry and hydrogen atoms (when ignored with the Ignore stereo and ignore hydrogens option).\n\nThe number of substitutions with `--substitutions=n` can be in the range of 1:2 * nb of bond characters in the SMILES string to 2:2 * nb of bond characters in the SMILES string. Here is a full list of SMILES bond characters and the maximum number of substitutions that can be made on them:\n\nYou can exclude specific substitutions using the --substitutions and --substitutions=n options, which can help reduce redundancy. For example: COc1ccc(NC(=O)Cc2ccc(Br)cc2)cc1 can be randomized to:\n\nOc1cc[C@@](CC(=O)[CC@@](CO)[CC]2Cl)(NC1CCCC2)[Cl2]c1C=O\n\nCC[C@H](Oc1ccccc1)C(=O)NN1CC1CCCCCN1\n\nCOc[C@@](CC(=O)[CC@](CO)Cl)(Nc1cncn[C@@](Cc2ncn1c2)c1)(NC1CCCCC1)C=O\n\nIf multiple options from the above list are provided, then all will be applied.\n\nThe substitutions in a molecule can overlap between each other: COc1ccc(CN(C)C(=O)CC[C@@H]2CCC[C@@H](CNC(=O)[C@@H](O)C2CCCc3[nH]ncc3)c2)cc1\n\nCC[N@@C]2(C[C@H](Cc3c(C(=O)N4CCC(=O)[C@H](CCc5nc6)c3)c3(N(O)C4C)C5)c3)(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)CCc2(c1)CCc3(C)cc3)cc2)c1O\n\nO=C(CSc1ccc(N(C(=O)Cc2nncn[C@H](CN(C(=O)[C@H]2O)CC[C@H]', '3: 1: 1: 30.0: 8.0: 0.0 1: 0\n: 0.0: 2.5 Done.\n\nThis entry has 1 part(s)\n\nIn this entry, the SMILES string for a molecule is specified as the input in the format shown above.\n\nThe output structure may be written in four formats depending on parameters specified, PDB, MOL2, SMILES or MOLFILE.\n\nNote that the output is also written in the format of the input (PDB, MOL2 or SMILES)']",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0,10

In particular, these molecules, usually small organic molecules (or peptides or monoclonal antibodies), aim to prevent the growth of cancerous tumors (antineoplastic agents or anticancer drugs), to prevent the spread of infections (antibiotics), to treat conditions such as asthma or HIV/AIDS, to treat pain, and to counter depression and other mood disorders.\n\nIn this challenge, you will be asked to design a novel molecule. A novel molecule has the following properties:\n\n- Is valid: the SMILES is not illegal\n- Has no duplicate atoms\n\nIn this challenge, the only valid SMILES you must produce will be ones that are novel. Note that you may find a lot of novel SMILES by generating random SMILES and asking the challenge server to validate them. You would then discard the duplicates.\n\nNote that there are many different ways to implement the rule: that the drug must be valid; but many possible solutions to the rule that there must be no duplicate atoms. It it is possible to solve the rules in either order, but I would recommend that you first write a solver for the rule that the SMILES string must be valid. Then you have a set of valid possible SMILES that may or may not have duplicate atoms in one or more locations. Now you can write a simple routine that loops over each possible SMILES in your set and determines if it has duplicate atoms; if for some SMILES strings it does not. Note that one solution to the rule that the molecule should be novel, might be to try all atoms from all possible SMILES strings in your valid set.\n\nI am using a set of rules for the purposes of this challenge as it is a well formulated task: it is easy to ask, and it is easy for you to test that you have done the task. A task that is hard to ask in one sentence (such as describe a molecule that has a wide spectrum anti-infective action, and with no known side effects or allergic reactions), is hard for you to test that you have done it right or wrong.']",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

The structure of the molecule can be defined by using 5 building blocks: Acetic Acid (C2H4O2 / ‘O=C/C=O/C’, O), Phenol (C6H5OH / ‘C1CCC=CCC1’, C), Ethanol (C2H6O / ‘OCCC’, O), Benzoic Acid (C7H5COOH / ‘C1CCC=CCCC=CC1’, O) and Acetic Anhydride (C4H6O3 / ‘OC(=O)OC(=O)C=O’, O). The formula of a building block is shown with standard IUPAC nomenclature (where C, H, O or N indicate an atom of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, respectively) and parentheses contain IUPAC bonding information. The letter at the end of the name indicates the atomic group, where O indicates one that contains an oxygen atom, C a carbocation, N a nitrogen base, an H a hydrogen and a double bond is represented by ‘=’.\n\n2. These 5 building blocks can be synthesized in many different orientations, which are represented by different SMILES strings. For example, consider phenol:\n\nC1CCC=CCC1 (phenol)\n\nthis can be interpreted as the parent carbon atom (indicated as 1) holding a single phenol ring (indicated as ‘C1CCC=CCC1’)\n\nHowever, the phenol ring can also be rotated in two other orientations around the parent carbon atom of the molecule:\n\nC1CCC=C1C=C1C1 (phenol)\n\nand:\n\nC1C=CCC1=CC1 (phenol)\n\nThe string of symbols after the parent carbon atom specifies how many carbon atoms are involved in the ring, with every “C” indicating a single carbon atom. A “C=C” indicates a double bond, and a “C=” indicates a triple bond between the parent and child carbon atoms. Every two carbon atoms are represented by the symbol ‘CC’, whereas any other number can be represented by the child carbon number, followed by “=”, and then the number of carbon atoms involved in the ring.\n\nThe same rules apply for Acetic Acid, Ethanol, Benzoic Acid and Acetic Anhydride, as indicated in the following table:\n\nBuilding Block SMILES Specification\n\n3. As there are 6 different permutations possible for each of the 5 building blocks we seek to combine, giving a total of 6 ^{5} = 7776 possible strings, where some will not be possible syntheses in the manner we described in exercise 041.\n\nWe seek an optimized formula, with as few hydrogen atoms as possible, which is not only synthesizable, but which contains a single atom.\n\n4. Given 2 lists, you can get the nth and last element in 0(1) time, not 0(|n|). Therefore any algorithm which tries every permutation will be worse that O(n^{5}) and thus will not be an efficient approach.\n\nWe will instead make use of the “string generation” pattern from exercise 042. Using the recursive function SMILESGenerate(n,s) with base case n = 0, and a recursive step that iterates through every permutation of the current string, we can generate a string of n elements which satisfies the criteria of a SMILES string and also contains a single parent C atom. The SMILES function is also given an optional argument “p” where p = parent, p = phenol, p = ethanol, p = benzoic acid, p = acetic acid, p = acetic anhydride respectively, so that they can be used in generating a synthesis.']",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

Once we have completed these steps, we will have a single novel organic molecule SMILES representation that can be used to access its molecular structure from a valid SMILES string.', ""N, N-Dimethyl-6-amino-hexanamide. I will write about the general process of how you can compute SMILES on your own, how they are often used, and will also give you some additional hints that I think you will find useful.\n\nSMILES stands for 'Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System.' It is a way to express a chemical formula or molecule (using a standard set of rules or 'dictionary') so that a computer (or a human!) can understand it. SMILES will let you type a chemical compound into your computer, then that computerized information can be translated into a computer, which can in turn be translated into chemical reality. By combining a few letters and numbers, the process of making a chemical compound can be greatly simplified and organized.\n\nSMILES was originally created at the University of Zurich in the mid-1980s' by a group of chemists. The primary aim was to standardize a method that allowed a computer the ability to manipulate molecular structures, especially when it came to 3-Dimensional representations (3-D molecules).\n\nThe purpose of this lesson is to show you a 'recipe', or 'steps', or 'rules' by which you can go about making SMILES yourself.\n\nI will provide you with a number of specific rules/steps that I have found to be helpful in the creation of a SMILES representation for a single-compound.\n\n- Each atom must be identified by an atom-type identifier, and a unique number. All Hydrogens will simply be given the identifier H.\n- For each compound, there must be a single atom that is designated as the 'root'. The root will always be given the number '1'. This atom will always be C, in SMILES for organic molecules.\n- All atoms in SMILES are listed in alphabetical order. All atoms connected to the root will have a single-letter identifier which represents the atom-type. There is normally no need to identify atoms further. Each atom must be a single alphanumeric character, which identifies the atom type, and the number. For example, all Carbon atoms will get the number '1', while all Hydrogens will get the number '2', etc. If the atom needs to be defined a little further, there are a number of common notations (and examples) to follow:\n    - H1: a single bond to the C root atom;\n    - O2-3: an oxygen atom with a negative charge (O-);\n    - S1+2: a Sulphur atom that is a +1 in charge;\n    - C34=5: a double bond of Carbon with a negative charge (C-);\n    - C6-2-1: a triple bond of a Carbon +2 with a +2 of Hydrogen.\n- All bonds will be represented by a single alphabetic character. All bonds will be listed in alphabetical order:\n    - Dash (-): a double bond;\n    - Dotted (-.): an aromatic bond;\n    - Asterisk (*): a triple bond;\n    - Tilde (~): a bond that's not present in the structure, but that is implied.\n- All single bonds will get the dash (-) notation. If a double or triple bond is required, the dash, dotted, or asterisk notation is used.\n- The root of the structure (and all single bonds) will be separated by a single space, and the double/triple bonds will also be separated by a single space.\n- Each atom will have one or more connection to one or more other atoms - bonds are always listed in alphabetical order!\n- A 'period' (.) is used to represent a lone pair of electrons on an atom that doesn't have a direct bond to a neighboring atom.\n\nNow, you will need to decide what your root is going to be in this system. For the purposes of this lesson, we’ll call the carbon atom the root and it will have the number ‘1’. This does, however, work for other molecules including alcohols, acids, bromide compounds, etc. (though the root will need a more specific definition). Because we are all chemists here, we will be assuming this is what we are doing. So let’s jump in and get started! We are going to take the following compound:\n\nStep 1: Draw 3D structure. First, just draw the 3D structure for the compound.\n\nHere's what I drew:\n\nStep 2: Represent the structure as a single-bond line. When drawing S"", 'the molecule must\n\n(a)   have atoms bonded covalently\n\n(b)   contain at least one of C, N or P.\n\nThe SMILES are to contain NO H, so you will have, e.g. instead of C = O, ‘CO’.\n\nYou will also need to use special SMILES characters to designate ring structures which would otherwise be difficult to convey: these are given below.\n\nThe following list of 12 organic compounds (which are NOT to be used in the assessment for this exercise) is provided as an indication or some of the different types of compounds which could be drawn:\n\nNote that\n\n- only ONE compound per person is allowed.\n- each compound in the list has a CAS number (this is a unique number assigned to every compound used industrially and in academia. This should be an integer without decimal point).\n- For each novel compound, you should provide the CAS number, name, IUPAC name (and abbreviation) and provide a graphical representation of the molecule and SMILES structure (both a line diagram and the atom map) and structure (as a ChemDraw structure file, or similar).']",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

SMILES notation was originally developed by two Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) members, the late David Weininger and Charles “Skip” Pearson, in the early 1980s to create a uniform method of representing organic and inorganic structures so they could be shared in databases.\n\nThis is possible due to the fact that all organic compounds can be described as being made from atoms of only hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and about 26 other elements. The molecule’s atoms are represented by single letters; for example: C, O, N, H, Br. Substitutions on various functional groups can be represented by an @ followed by a number representing the atomic position and the letter C, N, O, H, Br etc. For example: O[C@@H] means oxygen with a hydrogen substitution on the third atom.', '\n\nYou can specify a similarity score between the generated molecule and the one in SMILES with a maximum distance (in terms of bond or atom) between atoms that will be taken into account when the similarity matrix is calculated.\n\nPlease, note that the molecule you can generate cannot be chemically identical to the SMILES you can give as input (since otherwise it will not be similar but the same).\n\nFor example, with this SMILES: Nc1cnc(c12)n12 and a maximum distance between molecules of 4 you will have 5 results including C2=NC(CN2)C(=N)C(=O)C(CN2)C21, which has only 3 bonds different from the one given.\n\nIn particular, this is a molecule with a tetracycline structure.\n\nFor example, this SMILES generates molecules including benzylpiperazine: C1(C=CC(=C1)N2c(C)n(CC)c(O)n12)c2c1cc2C, with maximum molecular distance 4 this formula: CCCC(=O)C(C=C(=N(N)C2C)C)C1(=N)C(=CC2=CCNC(=N)C(=O)N(C)C)C, C(C=CCCl2)NCNS(=O)(Cc1nc(N)n1nc(N)c(O)C)C, C(C=CCCl2)NCNS(=O)(Cc1nCc(=NCN(C)C)n1c(N)nC)C.\n\nThis application generates a set of three-dimensional molecules similar to a given one from a SMILES file.\n\nYou will have to upload, as input, the files containing the SMILIE of the molecule (that you will like to use as a model) with a maximum distance between molecules.\n\nThis SMILIES will contain a molecule (the first row) and will have a minimum of two rows which are the atoms names with a number (this is a molecule with more than 100 bonds).\n\nIn particular, this application returns molecules that look like the one you have given as a model.\n\nThe maximum distance of atoms in the given molecule respect to the model is taken into account in the generation process.\n\nYou can generate a similar molecule with up to 10 atoms in a row\n\nFor example\n\nNc1cnc(c12)n12 generates molecules similar to the model as a minimum difference between the model and generated molecules is 3 and more of 10 atoms in a row can be generated.\n\nThe molecule must be generated from the structure of one given molecule which is written in SMILIES format.\n\nThe input SMILIES have to contain a molecule (first row) and the second row will have the atom names with a number (the molecule has more than 100 bonds)\n\nA molecule similar to the one that is given as input must be returned.

(If the -CO and -OH are both in the ionizable group, then they should be separated by the O at the head of the C=O group.)\n- Additional 1, 2, 3, and 4 oxygen atoms and 1, 2, 3, and 4 carbon atoms to help the molecule have more hydrophobicity\n\nThe molecule must also be a real molecule.\n\nThe scoring of the answer is as follows:\n\n## Constraints\n\n### 1. No extra bonds can be added (or removed).\n\nThe molecule must be chemically identical to the original molecule. Here the molecular weight of the molecules is calculated using the atom count, and not the bond count. This allows the algorithm to be robust to errors in the chemical formulas and gives the algorithm more freedom in the creation of the new molecules.\n\nExamples of constraints that are not part of the competition:\n\n- The hydrogen count of the molecule can be increased when using 2 as the default hydrogen count.\n- The atoms are able to be relocated.\n- The atoms have 2 or more hydrogen atoms (this is used to make the relocation less restrictive).\n\n### 2. The molecule does not have to be a unique structure.\n\nThe molecule can be used multiple times, and can also be present in multiple locations in the molecule (this is used for the relocation rule mentioned above).\n\n### 3. The molecule's chemical formula should be balanced.\n\nThe molecule should contain the following elements:\n\n- Oxygen: between 1 and 7 oxygens.\n- Carbon: between 1 and 7 carbons.\n\nThere are no rules for the -O, -N, -S, and -H groups. This is because they can come from the other atoms or can be created from the -NH/-COOH groups.\n\n### 5. All the bond lengths must be between 0.8 and 2.5 angstroms.\n\nThe bond lengths are calculated using the Van der Waals radii, which are available here.\n\n### 6.

You can only use rules that have been published, and can not use any external input.\n\nThe rules must be written in a way that allows a computer program to run through them. Here are some examples of rules that you can use:\n\n1. For every -COOH group in the molecule:\n    1. Remove the -COOH group from the molecule.\n2. Remove any of the -NH/-COOH groups that are already ionized (i.e., -COO^{-} or ionizable -NH_{2}).\n3. For each -NH/-COOH group, replace the -NH/-COOH group as a -CH_{2}-. This should be done at a random location in the chain.\n4. For each -C=O group, if it is not a part of the -NH/-COOH group, add a -CH_{2}- between the -C=O and the -COO group. This should be done at a random location in the chain.\n5. The -NH and -COOH groups must be separated by at least 2 carbon atoms.\n6. Do not add extra bonds to the molecule.\n\nSome other examples of the types of rules that can be used:\n\n1. Add oxygen atoms.\n2. Remove oxygen atoms.\n3. Add carbon atoms.\n4.

Also, it contains the double bond at the first and second C atoms. Also, at the first C atom it is an alcohol group of the three-member ring, which it has the only C atom and two O atoms.\nSo, the two C atoms of the double bond we can replace them with the other atoms to form the rest structure. But here, we face a problem that because of the double bond, so we cannot replace the first C atom directly with our desirables since it is not possible having more than one bond with one C atom.\nTherefore, we need to remove the double bond by adding two more carbons on both sides of the double bond.\nThen, we can place our desirables.\nThe desirable are two C atoms and two N atoms.\nFirst, one can replace the third C atom of the carbon chain with any desirable, so with C atom and then we can add the N atom on the side of the carbon chain.\nThen, we can place another C atom to replace the second-last C atom of the carbon chain. And then place the second N atom to replace the carbon chain. (Alternatively we can replace C atoms with N atoms and vice versa. We can add the C atoms to replace N atoms and vice versa.) Therefore the following structures are shown:\nFinally, we can replace the first C atom of the carbon chain with our final desirable as a N atom.\nSMILES notations:\nNCC1C(O)CC2C=C(C3=O)NC4C(=O)CN3CC5CC6=CC(N4)=CC=C64CC1NC55C1C1C1O2\nNC1C(O)CC2CC(=O)CC3C4CCC3CC=CC(OCC4)CC1C5CC6CC(CN5)=CC=C64CC1N3CC6CC4N31', 'CCCC(C(C)C4=NC3=NC31)C=CC=C3C4=CC(C(C)CC5=CC6(=O)CC7=CC=C(CC3C4)=C1)=N2.\n\nTo construct a SMILEs of a molecular structure, it is better to start with a simple molecules and gradually increase their complexity. This can be done by replacing the individual atoms and replacing them with groups. To make it easier to write such a SMILEs, it is enough to use the table of abbreviations for common chemical structures that contain information on which notation can be used. The SMILEs of the molecules can be drawn using the Marvin program, which allows you to quickly draw the necessary molecule from a chemical sketch.\n\nThe task is set to develop a structural analogue of the molecule.

A central carbon with four substituents (two bonded to an external ring and two bonded to the central cyclobutane) is a highly rigidized site, and it is important to maintain the presence of this ring and this functionality without introducing strain into the ring. Preserving this carbon ring also preserves the ability of the cyclobutane ring to adopt the correct conformation to interact with proteins and other molecules within the biological setting.', ""\n\n### Clue\n\nThe most common grouping on the string of atoms is benzene (CC16CCCC1C(C)CC16)\n\n### Answer\n\nAs discussed in the last clue, the most common grouping of atoms in this SMILES string is the set of atoms that make up C6H6, or benzene. If you look at the molecular orbital diagram for benzene, you'll note a cyclic delocalization of pi electrons around the ring. In other words, the pi orbitals of the molecule are not localized on one atom, but are spread out over a set of adjacent atoms. If you were to add an electron-withdrawing group to one of the atoms in a benzene ring, you would expect the ring electrons to localize, as the electrons try to avoid the charges of two atoms nearby. This delocalization has several effects on many of the compounds that contain a benzene ring. When an electronegative group is placed on a ring atom, for instance, then the ring becomes more acidic. This clue's answer is a molecule with a benzene ring. The ring atom with the substitution is an alpha-chloro-nitrobenzene (the electron withdrawing groups are a chlorine and a nitro group).\n\n### Teacher's notes\n\nThis problem is similar to one in the answer for the previous clue; the idea is to have students think about the delocalization of pi electrons in the ring, and how different substituents and functions have different effects on these electrons. This clue was provided by an actual student; the problem can easily be modified so that the substituents are replaced with some other functional group. This could be used in an assignment similar to the following:\n\nProblem: Draw 4 organic molecules with the following characteristics; one for each function.\n\n1. Benzene ring with electron-withdrawing group\n2. Dienic system (either linear or bridged-ring diene)\n3. Carbonyl group\n4. Tertiary amine\n\n(The above problem was in the form of a test question in a class in which a large number of students have a degree with chemistry (14% of the class) or a degree in which chemistry was the primary focus of their degree (about 7% of the class). For the students who have these backgrounds, I tried to make the questions somewhat similar to the kinds of questions which they might see in their introductory organic course. The question is, of course, not so specific for other students.)\n\n(return to first problem)""]",,,,3,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

Here is one such answer: NN=C1C=CNN=CC2=CCOC1=NCC2. This is why we need more criteria to identify a true SMILES string. We can ask for the generated molecule to also obey the following criteria: a) the generated string should be the shortest possible from among the SMILES strings that satisfy the original molecule\'s properties, and b) the distance from H to H should be no more than 3, and c) the chirality of the generated molecule should be close to the chirality of the original molecule.\nTo compare the distances between any two atoms, find the shortest path between these two atoms. You can think to walk on each atoms as a small ant walking on a chess board where the atoms are the squares. Suppose we have some atoms $A, B, C... Z$ , if there is a path (i.e., a sequence of atomic neighbor edges) from atom $A$ to atom $B$, then, atom $A$ and $B$ are said to be connected, and call that $A\\leftrightarrow B$ is true. In this case, we can construct a complete graph\n\nwith vertex $(A, B)$ and edge $(a, b), a\\leftrightarrow b$ for each atom $a,b$ that are connected. Now if $(A, B)$ is an edge between vertices in the graph, then the integer distance $d$, between $A$ and $B$ is the minimum sum of integer distances $(a, b): a\\leftrightarrow b, a\\in A, b\\in B$. The atom $A$ and $B$ are said to form a distance $(A, B)=d$.\nIn order to compare the chiralities of the original molecule and the generated molecule, we can look at the parity of certain atoms. The parity is 0 means all adjacent pairs are neighbors. For each carbon atom of the original molecule, count the number of unpaired bonds (i.e., the bonds to the nitrogens). Then take the sum of these unpaired-bond count for all the atoms. Modulus this sum by 2 (because we are always concerned with even/odd numbers). Modulus 2 will return a zero or one, i.e., 0/1. Then compare the chiralities of the original molecule and the generated molecule by compare its parity. For example, $\\mathrm{NNCC\\equiv CC\\equiv CCCOCCO}$, here the parity is 0, while $\\mathrm{NNCCCN\\equiv CC\\equiv CCCOCCN}$, here the parity is 1, even though in some perspective they may look the same, in terms of comparing their chirality, they are different.\nWith the above criteria, you should generate the following molecule using the SMILES string: NN=C1C=CNN=CC2=CCOC1=NCC2. We can think of the above criteria as a quality of the SMILES string. Given a SMILES string and a target molecule, we can ask for the similarities between the target molecule and the SMILES string, these similarities are of course quality of SMILES strings in the perspective of generating molecules from SMILES strings. In the above SMILES string, there are 2 bonds that are the ""core"" of this problem, i.e., the single bond between Carbon and the Hydrogen on the left side of the nitrogen, and the single bond between Carbon and the Hydrogen on the left side of the oxygen. Those two bonds can be converted to double bonds, to nitrogen-nitrogen bonds, and to single bonds. The core of a SMILES string is the same as the core of a molecule. The atoms around the core atoms can be changed as far as the core atoms\' neighbor atoms\' qualities remain similar to the neighbor atoms in the target molecule; i.e.,\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}& & & & {\\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}}_{\\text{similar}\\phantom{\\rule{thinmathspace}{0ex}}\\text{core}}& \\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\\\\', '1\nThe molecules above were the target and similarity searches.\n\nSelect the similarity search you would like to use: tanimoto\nSelect a library against which to search: ZINC150\nSpecify minimum similarity threshold [0.000, 1.000]:200\nMaximum number of files to return:50000\nThe library you have chosen contains 15012846 molecules\nThe similarity search will be submitted for completion.

Most common symmetric molecule structures are a tetrahedral central atom. A tetrahedral arrangement of four other atoms around the central atom is the most common, not because it is the most stable, but because that is how nature creates chemical bonds. The two most prominent groups of tetrahedral molecules are Carbon Atoms (all four bonding positions filled with Carbon) and Nitrogen Atoms (three of the bonding positions with Hydrogen/Carbon, and the fourth position with just a lone pair). These types of molecules are called tetrahedral-hybrid atoms.\n\nOther examples of tetrahedral and/or symmetrical structures are:\nBuckminster Fullerene and its analogs\nEthylene Glycol\nHydrogen Peroxide\nTraces of other compounds in water\nCyclic structures with double and/or triple bonds\n\nThe most common structure of the hydrogen atom, in both SMILES and 3D space, is the tetrahedral molecular structure. It has two pairs of bonding electrons and two non-bonding electrons. The non-bonding electrons form a circle around the lone bonding Hydrogen.\n\nOne of the most commonly found of these is Hydrogen Peroxide. Hydrogen Peroxide is found in the atmosphere as ozone and also in living tissues, specifically in the cells where it is used to kill bacteria. However, the molecule has a tendency to destroy the cells that it is trying to protect against bacteria. That is why the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in a single cell can only be about 4 ppm or less.\n\nIn addition to Hydrogen Peroxide, other non-bonding electron isomers are also found in both nature and synthesized molecules. These include ammonia, nitrous oxide, and cyanates, all of which have non-bonding electron isomers.\n\nAmmonia, in its most common form, has two non-bonding electrons. However, this is a linear structure. In other forms, however, the molecule has only one non-bonding electron (which in the case of ammonia is the lone electron on the far right side).\n\nIt is interesting to note that the linear form of ammonia, (where only the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms share the two double bonds), is also a molecule with a non-bonding electron isomer. In this molecule, the hydrogen is bonded to the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom, which is why ammonia is sometimes called an oxygen oxide.\n\nAnother interesting example is the non-bonding electron isomer of the organic molecule, malic acid. Malic acid is actually a type of organic acid that can actually be synthetically produced. In the organic syntheses of malic acid, the three double bonds are broken in favor of a single bond. The non-bonding electron isomer is formed in the presence of water because the carbon atom is bonded to the hydrogen that is not bonded to the lone pair on the oxygen.\n\nA third non-bonding electron isomer is found in the molecular structure of the molecule known as the cyano-cyanates. This molecule is one of several organic compounds in which the carbon atoms are all connected by a single bond. The two non-bonding electron isomeric structures are found in the molecule in which the carbon atoms are connected by double bonds. Other types of isomers, such as the cyano-carbonates, have no such electron isomeric structures.', ""\n\nCC1N2C(=O)C(=C1C=C2C1)=O\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nHere we've identified the commonalities among our given SMILES strings above — a central, open chain with an amide, an ether, ammonium, and another amide moiety.\n\nWe'll use this information along with the following steps during our synthesis of a new molecule:\n\n1. Draw a backbone using one of the common moieties from the SMILES strings (i.e., C=O).\n2. Look to the other common features to determine how best to attach the other moieties to the backbone.\n3.

Then, a dendrogram is created that indicates the relationship between the molecules in the group. This algorithm uses a vector of distances instead of a distance matrix. The result is shown here:\n\nThis image creates 3 clusters.\n\n1. Asterisk: Asterisk is a good descriptor of the oxygen functional group.\n\n2. Oxygen-carbon bonds: A two to three bonds indicates the presence of two oxygen to carbon bonds (e.g. in the molecule O=c=nc=cnc1cc2=c3C3CC=C31)\n\n3. Triple bond present: The number of triple bonds is an indicator for the presence of one or more triple bonds.\n\n4. Charge: In the group with the asterisk, the three molecules have charges.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nNext, I used MOLMOTIF to obtain the vector of 1636 bit that characterizes each of the three groups. The resulting bit vectors are shown below:\n\n3 groups\n\nBit vectors correspond from left to right: 7-membered ring, molecule 2, molecule 3\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nAfter solving the first 2 steps in this problem, I solved the same problem with 192 molecules, and I obtained the following similar bit vector patterns. The following table indicates the number of occurrences of the patterns.\n\nThese patterns are very similar to the ones found in the example, and for this analysis I assume that the original examples (the 4 molecules above) and the larger test were generated under the same rules (same conditions).\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nFrom the patterns obtained in the previous step, I synthesize a molecule that could fit in this group. I started by using the grouping rules of step 1 above. Then, I use the pattern with the highest occurrence. The result is shown below:\n\nMy solution for the problem.\n\nIn summary, a molecule of 4 bonds separated from the ring, 2 charges present, two hydrogen atoms, a CCO substructure, and the presence of two aromatic double bonds, could provide a new member of the group.\n\nThis post was created based on a response to a LinkedIn discussion post.
