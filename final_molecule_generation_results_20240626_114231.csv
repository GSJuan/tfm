It was developed by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences in 1988.\n\nThe SMILES format represents chemical structures by using a simple character notation. A SMILES string is a sequence of letters, numbers and punctuation marks, which is interpreted by a specific chemical structure encoding algorithm. It is very simple to read SMILES strings manually. As SMILES strings are just simple letter sequences, you can print them in plain text format or even use them in URLs for web applications. Additionally, with a little familiarity, it easy to read the structure of a molecule by just looking at its SMILES notation.\n\nA SMILES strings consists essentially of the following characters and letter combinations:\n\n- letters and numbers - used to encode the chemical structure\n- parenthesis, bracktes and other punctuation marks - used as grouping, modifying, or quantifier operators\n- the at-sign character `@` or the hash character `#` - used for bond type and stereochemical markup\n- the newline character `\\n`, or the linefeed character `\\l` - used for splitting long SMILES strings over multiple lines\n- white space characters like space, tab and line feed - used to enhance readability\n\n## Reading a SMILES string\n\nThe best way to read SMILES strings is to first learn to distinguish the different types of characters in a SMILES string. The different types of characters can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Atomic symbols\n2. Conectivity operators\n3. Aromatic markers\n4. Bonds\n5. Grouping symbols\n6. Quantifiers\n7. Stereochemical markers\n8. Newline markers\n9. White space characters\n\nThe following subsections describe the different types.\n\n### 1. Atomic symbols\n\nThe simplest objects in a SMILES string, the atomic symbols, correspond to atoms in a chemical structure. In most cases, the atomic symbols are identical to the atomic symbols in the periodic table. However, there are some exceptions:\n\n- The element chlorine is abbreviated with the symbol `Cl` in a SMILES string, but the upper case letter `CI` in the periodic table.\n- Helium is represented in SMILES strings as `H`, while the symbol `He` is used in the periodic table.\n\nThe atomic symbols need to follow the chemical periodic systems, meaning that atoms which have similar chemical properties belong to the same group in the periodic table (and also in a SMILES string). The following table lists all the different periodic groups in SMILES strings along with their corresponding periodic symbols:\n\n### 2. Conectivity operators\n\nThe conectivity operators are the letters `X`, `C`, `=`, `#` and `>`. They are used to draw the bonds connecting two atoms. Each conectivity operator describes a different type of bond:\n\n- `#` - drawn as a single bond\n- `=` - drawn as a double bond\n- `C` - drawn as a triple bond\n- `X` - drawn as an aromatic carbon atom\n- `>` - drawn as a dative bond\n\nThe following diagram shows the bond types for which each conectivity operator is used.\n\nCaption: Available bond types\n| Type | Connecivity operator | SMILES code | Arrow symbol |\n| Single bond | `#` | `#` |  |\n| Double bond | `', '123\n\nGenerate a single, novel molecule in SMILES format.

The Kohonen network is an algorithm for clustering, and they are often used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets.\n\nKohonen networks are similar to multilayer perceptrons, in the sense that an input vector is passed to one or more layers of weighted nodes. But the similarity ends there, as the output of a Kohonen network is a single output node instead of multiple output nodes that can be weighted to represent a numeric variable or a class. In addition, the connections between the input and output layers of neurons are fully-connected instead of being organized into layers. So the main difference is that we have a single output neuron whose weight is updated in a manner that clusters the input vectors to minimize the distance between the input vector and the weight vector in a high-dimensional space.\n\nThe above network is an example of a 2-layer network with 4 connections between the input and output layer. The input nodes would be connected to 4 nodes in the output layer, and each of the input nodes would be connected to each of the output nodes. The only difference between a fully-connected 2-layer network and such a network is that the weights of the output nodes do not represent individual classes but are instead a single vector that is meant to represent the input vector.\n\n### So What the Heck are Kohonen Maps?\n\nThe simplest way to think of a Kohonen network is to think of it as a data visualization tool. The most common application is to reduce the dimensionality of spatial data to a low number of dimensions. So, instead of using 50 dimensions to describe a 50 by 50 grid of data, you could just use a single plane to visualize the grid. This visualization is referred to as a map, and each neuron on the map is sometimes called a point of interest.\n\nTo understand this better, consider K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers. When we classify a vector into one of K classes, the weight vector that represents each class is just the weighted sum of the inputs. So we’d have some set of training data, where we might find that the following combination of weights, when fed into any input vector, would yield a class that is closest to the input:\n\nwhere $W_{0.5}$ weights the input by 0.5, $W_x$ weights the input by 1, and $W_{0.25}$ weights the input by 0.25.\n\nSo, after we process the inputs of a bunch of training data, a set of weight vectors will be stored. When we want to predict the classes of other training data, we could find all inputs into which that weight vector would map, and then we could see which class would be most common among those inputs–this is a typical process for KNN algorithms.\n\nTo use Kohonen maps for visualization purposes, we need to store the weights by input vector, rather than by class. Instead of storing the weights by class, we’ll store the weights by input data. After we store the weights for the training data, we can use an input vector that we haven’t stored to find which weights from the learned model would map those inputs. Then use each of those weighted vectors to represent the input vectors we have not stored.\n\n## Kohonen Neurons and Algorithms\n\nThe most famous research in the field of Kohonen networks was done by Tuevo Kohonen, who devised an algorithm that uses the following steps:\n\n1. Generate an input vector with N features\n2. The input vector is added to each of the output vectors.\n3. After all the input vectors are added to the output vectors, the input vector is subtracted by each weight vector.\n4. Once each vector has been subtracted from each weight vector, choose the closest point between them.\n5. Update each weight vector by using the following formula: $w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + alpha * input_{ij} - output_{ij}$. So if the input vector is (1,1,1), and we have 3 weight vectors, and each weight vector has the value (2,2,2), then the following result will be produced:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 5', ""1) Do not answer with an attachment that does not contain only a single molecule in SMILES format 2) Do not answer with a screenshot or picture. Enter the SMILES string without brackets or smiles numbers between atoms: SMILES: SID: SMILES\n\nExamples: To obtain the correct answer: 1) Add H's only to the terminal carbon 2) Use only the numbers listed in the question 3) Add OH only to the end CCO 1 C 2 2 1 3) 14,45 1"", '5-methyl-2-fluoropyridin-3-amine\n\n1. Which ring is bigger? The left ring, because it contains one carbon and an atom of fluorine. The other ring contains one carbon and an atom of nitrogen.\n2. Which atom is a substituent and which atoms are part of the ring? The nitrogen and fluorine atoms are part of the ring. The carbon atoms are just connected by single bonds as substituents.\n3. In what order are the ring atoms written? The ring atoms are written in alphabetical order starting with nitrogen. CFLF\n\nThese are the general guidelines for writing SMILES:\n\nIn this case, the fluorine and the nitrogen have hydrogens on them, so the hydrogen must be specified in order to write the bonds correctly:\n\nFinally, the SMILES is written in all caps without parentheses or commas around the rings:\n\nThe SMILES code can be simplified to\n\nAnother method of simplification for this SMILES is to write the carbon and nitrogen atoms as 1 and 2. Also, the ring can be indicated as just [210], as the last carbon atom is implied by writing a single bond:', '1234- 5678. This is an answer in the SMILES language, which is a standardized way of representing the structure of a molecule. To view SMILES in a different format use ChemDoodle (see details below).\n\nWhat does the SMILES representation of the structure of the molecule?\n\nSMILES is an easily recognizable, computer-readable representation for all types of organic molecules. It can be used to represent all kinds of functional groups, chiral centers, cyclic structures, and disconnected molecules. It can also represent any number of functional groups or substitutions.\n\nWhere does SMILES come from?\n\nSMILES (for Simplified Molecular-input Line-entry System) was invented in 1987 by the Nobel prize-winning chemist, Robert Burns woodward to solve a common problem. It is a way of unambiguously representing the chemical structure of a molecule in just a few letters and numbers.\n\nWhy is SMILES important?\n\nIt is an alternative notation to depict chemicals structures which helps chemists and scientists by allowing them to quickly produce chemical structures when writing up reports and research. SMILES is a language which allows the representation of many different types of chemical structures; it is widely used by chemists in various fields.\n\nHow are SMILES formed?\n\nSMILES can have any name. A molecule can be represented in a graphical form in SMILES, which is very similar to the drawing for an isomer. You can specify the number atoms or bonds (h), the name of a molecule (n), and the number of bonds (b) between all atoms. In addition, this system is compatible with the MMDB database.\n\n## What is SMILES algorithm?\n\nThe algorithm of SMILES is the same. It only differs from that of SMILES in its syntax. A molecule in a graphical format can be represented in the form of SMILES. The name of the molecule and its structure can also be specified. The number of atoms and number of bonds is specified as a part of this process.\n\nWhat are the advantages of SMILES?\n\nSMILES is compact in size and it’s an easy way to write the structure of a molecule. For example we can write C1=C2C3=C4C5=C6=O1. The length of a molecule in the SMILES notation is calculated by adding the lengths of the molecule plus one on each side of the molecule (e.g. a molecule of size 4 would have a length of 7). SMILES can be used to represent the structure of any type of molecule (organic, polymer, polymers, peptides, proteins, etc.)\n\n### What are the limitations of SMILES?\n\nSMILES can only represent a graphical format. In order to represent a complex molecule you must use a computer program such as ChemSketch(tm) or MDL Chimera(tm) (both are free and very easy to use). For example, if you want to know how many carbon atoms (C) are in a particular molecule, you simply enter 3C into the SMILES editor, click “add atom,” and look at the length of the chemical structure. SMILES can only represent one type of molecule:\n\nWhy molecules are important in chemistry?\n\nWhy is chemistry important? Chemistry is the study of matter and the interactions that occur between the different atoms and molecules that make up everything around us.\n\nIt is used to describe the structures of molecules or substances or any other object. The word “molecule” is also sometimes used to describe a group of atoms or ions that form a particular structure. For example, an example of a molecule would be carbon dioxide , or CO2.\n\nWhy is SMILES?\n\nSMILES is a way to make a molecule more complex or to add more chemical substitutions to it. If you want to add a group of atoms to a particular molecule, and you need that molecule to be more complex or have more chemical substitutions on it, then SMILES can help you to do so. SMILES can be broken down into smaller units, and it can be used to help create other molecules.\n\n## What is the SMILES notation of a hydrogen atom?\n\nA SMILES is a way to write the structure of a molecule like this: hydrogen atoms are represented by a dot. Hydrogen atoms can also be represented as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, oxygen', '1. For the following reaction, write the SMILES of the product (answer only SMILES): 2. Reactions between amines and alkyl halides form amides with base catalysis. Draw the SMILES of the product (answer only the SMILES string): 3.

Here is an example of a structure for which hydrogen atoms are not specified — it is a structure named as 6-buten-1-ol.\n\nHere is another example of a structure with only some atoms having formal charges (not all).\n\nThis structure is drawn to represent a tetrahedral carbon atom having a negative charge. Since there are four possible orientations in the plane (one is shown here on the left). Each orientation should have an extra hydrogen atom attached to a free electron pair at the tetrahedral carbon atom to make a total of 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the tetrahedral carbon atom (as shown on the right below). This is a requirement of the valence bond theory.\n\nTherefore, these two structures should look like this with some extra hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms with formal charges:\n\nWhen representing structure in a chemical notation format, one can think of hydrogen atoms the same way one can think of helium atoms in chemistry.\n\nIt would be helpful for you to think of helium atoms in these pictures (see above) as hydrogen atoms.\n\n#### Problem\n\nGenerators are an important class of molecules and are useful in a number of applications when a specific application has no known effective solution.\n\nA generator might be as simple as a very large ring of one atom type (or it might be of any size or atom type that you can think of).\n\nThe generator below has a special type of structure. This structure can be a “reusable” or “repeated” structure that is easily created without breaking the rules for chemical bonds.\n\nAs you can see, it’s difficult to represent a generator in structural form when the number of atoms in the generator is very large (and when the types of atoms are numerous).\n\nThe easiest way to represent such generators is in a chemical notation format like SMILES.\n\nHere’s an example of a very large generator, named as a tetrahedral carbon atom:\n\n(S)C:(S)C(S)C:(S)C(S)\\C(S)C(S)C(S)/C[S](S)C(S):(S)C(S)C=C:\n\nThis generator contains atoms of some element or combinations from several elements.\n\nPlease generate just the SMILES string in the form as shown above.\n\n2D or 3D coordinates required later for docking. The structure for this exercise will be a very large generator.\n\n#### Analysis\n\nAnswer only the SMILES string:\n\n2D or 3D coordinates required later for docking. Structure for this exercise will be a very large generator.\n\n#### Solution\n\n(S)C:(S)C(S)C:(S)C(S)\\C(S)C(S)C(S)/C[S](S)C(S):(S)C(S)C=C:\n\nWhen you complete the molecular-modeling and docking portions for this assignment, the above structure should give an output with a single structure that gives a docking score of −50 or more!\n\n#### Important Notes\n\nMolecule model files (not applicable to structures with an asterisk in PDB format)\n\nWhen you enter your SMILES text into your molecular-model analysis software, you get an error (i.e., “No data to plot”). The most likely cause of this error is that the number of rotatable bonds in your structure exceeds the maximum number of rotatable bonds allowed for the output format you’ve selected. You may have to change the output format (e.g., go to a 3D format for a structure with 6 or more rotatable bonds).']",,,,7,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

CORINA will only accept strings with the hydroxyl group as a separator.\n\nYour solution is expected to be of the following general structure:\nHO-C(=O)<\n|\n1\n|\n2\n|\n3\n|\n4\n\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\n\nFor example, your solution may be:\n\nHO-C(=O)<\n|\n1\n|\n2\n|\n3\n|\n4\n\n-C1=CC(=O)O1-C(C(=O)O1)=C1\n-C1=CC(=O)O1-C(C=O)C(=O)\n-C1=CC(=O)O1-C(C=O)C(C=O)O1\n\nTo build your molecule, use the following steps:\n\n1. Build your 3 carbon backbone using molecule fragments A1 - A3 and a condensing segment between A3 and A4.\n\n2. Attach (via condensation) the side-chain segments B1-B3.\n\nReminders before building your molecule:\n1. Start from the carboxylic acid of the backbone carbon chain and build out to the carboxylic acid group at the end.\n\n2. Choose a fragment size such that the carboxylic acid groups in each end fragment can be easily condensed.\n\nHINT: This exercise can be completed using a structure builder software like CORINA (free online for molecules with less than or equal to 20 carbon atoms), or it can be completed by hand using the information in the table. The structure will have two hydroxyl groups.\n\n# Problem 2: Building CAS2069: Using the SMILES to create a molecule\n\nUse the following SMILES code as the starting point for the next exercises:\n\nIn the first exercise, you synthesized your own 3 carbon skeleton (a 6 carbon backbone) by synthesizing your own fragments and connecting them together.\n\nIn the second exercise, the 3-carbon backbone for building the next molecular fragment was provided.\n\nNow it is time to consider how to add to the backbone, and to synthesize the other half of the molecule.\n\nThe overall molecular skeleton is provided. You need to add the carbon skeleton shown in red to the structure in Figure 1. The red skeleton has the 2-carbon ""sticker"" for condensing to the structure on the left.\n\nWhen solving this problem, try to find the shortest chain of atoms you can to build the condensing group. (This means, for example, there is no need to start by building the 2-carbon side chain!)\n\nWhen you have completed the problem, look at the complete structure at the end of Unit 3. Notice the connections that were made (to atoms on CAS2069 in a place different from where the connection was made to the backbone).\n\n# Problem 3: Building CAS2069: Modifying the skeleton\n\nThis problem is identical to the problem in Problem 2, except in this case, you will modify the skeleton by removing atoms, and adding a new set of atoms, and/or moving atoms.\n\nFigure 1: CAS2069 has a ""sticker"" that can be attached to the left-hand end of the condensing group.\n\nYou are provided with a partially completed 6-', '\n\nThis molecule is part of a new class of drugs (called “Cyclic Pyranosides”) that can inhibit the growth of cancerous tumors.

Moses,mistral_base,zero_shot,Produce a SMILES representation for a single novel organic molecule:,,7,"['D-mannitol.\n\n## 8.2.1. The MOLFILE Format\n\nThe first type of chemical data file we describe is called MOLFILE. A MOLFILE is a simple text file which can contain multiple entries. Each entry contains the name of a molecule followed by the coordinates of each atom of the molecule. Each line is terminated with a newline character. The header, which is not part of the molecule information, begins with:\n\n```\nMOLFILE 1.20 1\n```\n\nThe 1.20 is the version number and can be ignored. The 1 at the end can be replaced by the number of entries to indicate the number of MOLFILE entries to follow. Most MOLFILE files simply use a single entry as shown by the following example:\n\n```\n>MOLFILE 1.20 1\n> 3322 10     8.2494 16.8173\n> 3322 20     5.8261 24.6133\n> 3322 30     3.8249 11.7515\n> 3322 40     5.4127 20.4347\n> 3322 50     5.9837  8.0358\n> 3322 60     3.8341 24.0933\n> 3322 70     3.6637 21.0665\n> 3322 80     2.0992  9.7798\n> 3322 90     4.4959 23.8949\n> 332210     0\n>ENDofMolfile\n```\n\nThis file describes a molecule of D_{2}O. The header is followed by 10 numbers: an SMILES code (3323), the number of atoms in the molecule (10), and the coordinates of each atom. The number after each atom is the atomic number of the atom. A 0 is designated as the end of the molecule. It is not uncommon for MOLFILEs which describe multiple entries to have a 0 at the end of each entry. These zeros can be ignored.\n\n## 8.2.2. SMILES representations\n\nOne of the most convenient ways of representing molecules is through SMILES. SMILES (pronounced “smiles”) stands for Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Structure. It is a line notation for representing organic compounds. SMILES is based on the way chemists represent chemical structures using line notation. For example, ethane can be represented as CH_{3}CH_{3}. Another common representation for molecules is that of a connected tree diagram with the atoms as the nodes and single bonds between the atoms as the edges. For organic molecules this tree representation reduces to a graph with C atoms as the nodes and bonds between the atoms. The C atoms (at least those that are sp^{3}-hybridized) represent the corners of a tetrahedron where one corner corresponds to a hydrogen atom and the other three corners to carbon atoms:\n\nThe SMILES string for a single substituted molecule then consists of a single letter representing the atom connected to all of the atoms represented in the tetrahedra (for example, C for ethane) separated by single lines to indicate bonds and enclosed with brackets in front and at the end.\n\nNotice that this representation does not designate which carbon atom is substituted. We call the carbon atoms and its connecting hydrogen atoms a substitution group. We label the atoms of the substitution group using Roman numerals that progress in the order that they appear in the SMILES starting with the substitution group ([1]). Thus the first carbon of the chain of ethane would be labeled [1].\n\nThe SMILES for ethene would be C=[1], since there are no other substituents.\n\n## 8.2.3. The Line Notation for Ethers\n\nWe now address the question of whether a substitution group (with two connected atoms) is designated as a “1” or “2”. For ethers we use a 1 as the substitution letter. Although ether may be named based on the alphabetical order of the groups to which it is attached, the order of the alphabet is determined by the name of', '\n\nThe molecule is 2-fluorophenylpyridine (2FP), produced using a technique known as photocopy decarboxylation to combine fluorene and 4-aminopyridine at 130 °C in chlorobenzene:\n\n### 2FP and some of its potential applications\n\n2FP is a potential photonic and electronic materials because of its optical property and structural stability. It demonstrates near unity quantum efficiency under excitation wavelengths between 400 and 600 nm, and a broad absorption spectrum over the entire visible range with tunability between 700 and 844 nm.\n\n2FP can potentially be used to produce organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). This is because it has a low band gap with a wide optical window and good electrical carrier mobility. Indeed, in addition to its use as a OTFT material, 2FP has some potential applications in the fields of optical fibers, lasers, solar cells, LEDs and transistors.\n\nAn overview of electronic and photonic OTFTs can be found in this book.', '\n\n1. Use the SMILES string in this example: OCC(C(C(O)C1OC(C(OC(C1)CCCCCC(CCC))O)C(C(OC(CCC)C1O)OC1OC2OC3OC(CCCCC(CCC))O)C(O)OC1OC1CCC)O)O\n2.

A single C atom, C, is represented by ""1"". A double-bonded C is represented by ""2"" for a λ=2 double bond. A triple-bonded C is represented by ""3"". A conjugated C is represented as 3+n, where n is the number of conjugated carbons plus one. For example, a conjugated C that is bonded to a second conjugated carbon and an aromatic carbon is represented as 3+2+1 = ""6"" (for conjugated bonds in the 2-carbon chain and the ring).\n\nAtoms other than carbon are also represented by special codes, which include:\n\n- H = hydrogen\n- O = oxygen\n- N = nitrogen\n- Cl = chlorine\n\nAdditionally, hydrogen atoms are also implicit by the code for other functional groups, such as alcohols, where one of the three H atoms are implicit.\n\nDifferent from the number coding for carbon atoms, functional groups are represented using a 3-character SMILES string, each beginning with a character that identifies the functionality. For example:\n\n- O: an alcohol is represented with ""OC"" for a primary alcohol and ""CO"" for a secondary alcohol.\n- C: a carbon-carbon single bond is represented simply with ""C"".\n\nYou have reviewed key vocabulary and concepts outlined in the following glossary terms.

This might be used to show the structure of organic isomers (structural isomers) in different forms, or to represent the isotopism of an organic molecule.\nThere are a variety of techniques available to you to create the string of SMILE for a structure, and these are discussed in further detail in the following sections, as part of the exercise.\nOne way to find the canonical SMILES string is to use a SMILES calculator that computes this string directly from the input data (or by using a different representation of the molecule, such as an InChI string) or by using an organic chemical calculator such as Organic Chemistry Online.\nYou must, however, determine that the molecule you have entered matches the molecule's chemical formula. The exercise is based on Organic Chemistry Online SMILES; however, the method may be easily adapted to include molecule isotopism or organic isomerism.\nFor example, the organic chemical isomerism for hexane and n-hexane may be represented as follows:\nThe SMILES representation of hexane (C-hexane)\nThe SMILES representation of n-hexane (CH3C CH2 C CH2 CH2 C-hexane)\nThe same techniques may be used to represent isotopism for all forms of the molecule, with the exception of the carbon isotope.\nThe isotopism of hex-1-ene may be represented as follows:\nThe SMILES representation of the isotope of hexane-1-ene\nThe isotopism of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane may be represented as follows:\nSMILES representation of the isotopism for 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane\nThe isotopism of a molecule of cyclohexane is represented as follows:\nSMILES representation of the isotopism for cyclohexane\nThere are two ways to create the SMILES representation of a molecule:\n• Creating a connection table• Use the organic chemicals online molecule SMILES calculator\nLet's look at how these strategies work in greater detail.\nStep 1. Determine whether the correct molecule\nThe most effective approach to produce a SMILES representation is to produce a connection table. This is accomplished by selecting the molecule from the list of molecule names (or by typing it in) and then hitting the 'View SMILES String' button to get the results.\nOrganic Molecules Online SMILES String for Cyclohexane\nHere are some other organic chemical molecules that can be used as an alternative source of molecules to practice building SMILES table.\nOrganic Chemistry Online SMILES String for CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3\nOrganic Molecules Online SMILES String for CH3CCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3\nOrganic chemistry online SMILES string for c35h80o10\nOrganic chemistry online SMILES string for c5h8o2\nTo verify that you have chosen the appropriate molecule as the starting and middle point for your table, look over the table you created.\nAlternatively, you might utilize the Organic Chemistry Online calculator to produce the necessary SMILES representation. In this instance, Organic Chemistry Online can be used to find both the canonical SMILES and the SMILES representation.\nOrganic Chemistry Online allows you to construct the connection table, and then it provides you the option of using the organic molecule SMILES calculator to calculate the SMILES representation by putting it in the search bar for organic chemistry online SMILES and clicking on the Organic Chemistry Online SMILES calculator.\nOrganic Chem"", ""hexadecaphenylchlorosilane.\n\nWe will provide a single, unambiguous, SMILES representation. However, this SMILES is not unique in its characterization of the structure of the molecule. It is possible to construct several additional, equally correct and unambiguous SMILES using only the six atoms and twelve bonds in hexadecaphenylchlorosilane. This means that, for example, hexadecaphenylchlorosilane could also be represented by the following equivalent SMILES:\n\n- [Si][C][C][C][C][C][C][C][C] [C][C] c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c1 c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c3 c13 c4 cc41 c5 cc51 c6 cc61 c7 cc71 c8 cc81 c9 cc91 c10 cc101 c11 cc111 c12 cc121 cc5 = O c13 = c41 c13 = c51 c13 = c61 c13 = c71 c13 = c81 c13 = c91 c13 = c101 c13 = c111 c13 = c121 cc8 = c91 cc10 = c111 cc12 = c111 c11 = C\n- O[Si][C][C][C][C][C][C][C] c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c1 c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c3 c13 c4 cc41 c5 cc51 c6 cc61 c7 cc71 c8 cc81 c9 cc91 c10 cc101 c11 cc111 c12 cc121 cc8 = O cc5 = c41 cc5 = c61 cc5 = c71 cc5 = c81 cc5 = c91 cc5 = c101 cc5 = c111 cc11 = c91 cc11 = c101 cc12 = c111 c11 = C\n\nIn short, we will give a unique SMILES, but note that there are other equivalent possible SMILES. You do not need to concern yourself with this when you encounter this problem in the future, however. Even though the representation of the structures is not unique, the SMILES is and its implications for the structural information it encodes will be accurate.\n\nProceed as follows:\n\n1. Look up the three-letter abbreviation for silicon in table 5-1.\n2. Since the silicon is not chlorinated, we need to add [ ] and the bond-connection point 'c' at a place in the string. Add this.\n3. Inspect the molecule and locate the nearest silicon to the chlorine. Then add the bond-connection point and the chlorine.\n4. Inspect the molecule and locate the nearest phenyl ring to the silicon. Then add the bond-connection point and the phenyl ring.\n5. Repeat step 4 four more times, connecting a phenyl ring.\n6. Then connect the phenyl rings to each other, one at a time, using the steps in figure 5.4.\n7. When you have gone around the outside of the molecule and connected all the phenyl rings to each other, you're done.\n\nCongratulations!

Let\'s have a little math to see how we got there.\n\nThe PubChem database\'s growth follows an exponential trend line. When it was launched in early 2004, about 1 million molecules were added over the next 18 months. Then the number of compounds added per month more than doubled. So we have 2^18 ≈ 262,000 entries per month.\n\nThat growth rate has stayed remarkably constant until recently. In February 2006, we recorded our 5 millionth entry (11 months after hitting the ten million milestone). This gives us 2^18 × 12 ≈ 800,000 entries per month.\n\nI don\'t think we will see another doubling of PubChem\'s growth rate for at least another couple of years (the 1 milestone came much faster than anticipated). Of course, our computational resources will continue to increase exponentially, and our ability to query those databases will improve, but I think we can anticipate a slower growth rate in the number of ""publishable"" compounds.', '=CC=C[nH]c2ccccc12(=O)O\n\n## Simile\n\n### Similar to SMILES for drug design\n\nSimile generates SMILES molecule strings that look similar to a given reference structure. Because the generated molecules are different in shape and structure compared to the reference, new chemical space is explored. The software is freely distributed with an easy web interface.\n\n### A tool for drug design\n\nNew compounds need to be designed for each drug target. A major objective is to generate compounds that have never been studied before, in order to open new chemical space. This is crucial to create unique compounds, with unique biological activities. It is a challenge to design novel molecules by hand or with the help of 3D visualisation software, such as MOE.\n\nThe molecules generated by Simile are different in shape and structure compared to the reference, and as such open new chemical space. Simile offers a simple user interface with a unique functionality on the market.\n\n### Molecular scaffolds, fragments, linkers\n\nMolecular fragments such as scaffolds are selected at random for each position, and linked in a random sequence to the reference scaffold.\n\nAn alternative way of creating new compounds is to use the existing links, but replace the parts by substituents. In the Simile interface, you also have the option to replace an existing substituent with a new substituent, or replace a fragment, such as a ring with a different ring. This option works particularly well for creating novel biaryl compounds.\n\nBy combining fragments and rearranging them in an intelligent, random way, Simile is able to create novel molecular scaffolds and molecules.\n\nThe software also supports the input of a list of molecules in which case the output list will only contain molecules that are not found in the input list. For example, all chloroketone analogues of a testosterone analogue can be found when you input the testosterone analogue list and the chloroketone molecule.\n\n### Outputs\n\nSimile can also output the novel molecules in standard formats such as SMILES and InChI. For each molecule the standard ID is used, such as Pubchem or DrugBank. Other names such as common name or IUPAC name can be provided as an option. For every molecule in the output, the software also generates the R-groups and receptor-based 3D description, if 3D SMILES is available. To view the 3D structures a click on the 3D link in the output will open the web viewer in a new window.\n\n### Licence\n\nThis software is free to use. It is distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.\n\n### Software\n\nTo use Simile, visit the web interface and simply enter the SMILES of your reference molecule in the text field. The fields for generating compounds and generating links can then be used to find compounds similar to your reference. You can click the button Generate on the left. The webpage will show a list of molecules that are similar to the input molecule. The output is ordered by cosmetic similarity, and a colour code is used to show the cosmetic similarity.\n\n### Output\n\nSimile has the ability to output the generated molecules in different format such as SMILES, InchI, SDF, R-group and PDB formats, as well as several options for downloads: a list of links to PubChem, DrugBank and ChEMBL databases, the cosmetic similarity matrix (the similarity between your generated compounds and each of the PubChem compounds), the receptor-based 3D descriptions of the molecules.\n\nThe output 3D structures can be visualised with the 3D viewer, which you can also use to manipulate the 3D structures.\n\n### Requirements\n\nPHP 5.6, Perl 5.30, MySQL5, Apache 2.4, Java. (This software is available on a separate webserver, it has not been integrated on the PRIME server.)\n\n### Contact\n\nIf you feel you are able to contribute, we would appreciate your help to develop the software on Github.', '. There are two things to do:\n\n- Generate the SMILES using your favorite tool (PyMOL has one and so does Chemmine-rs.)\n- Identify, with the help of Chemmine-rs, the part of the SMILES that is syntactically ill-formed\n\nSee the solution section below.\n\n## Generating SMILES\n\nPyMOL generates a SMILES that looks like:\n\n> CC(=O)Nc1cccc(NC(=O)CSc2nnc(C)n2C2CC2)c1\n\n## The SMILES is Syntactically Invalid\n\nChemmine-rs helps me identify a few things that render the SMILES technically invalid:\n\n- The molecule is drawn using ChemDoodleWeb.\n- There is no whitespace around the SMILES.\n- The number of atoms has no whitespace around it.\n\nI can fix all three things in an IDE, but Chemmine-rs is just a little command-line program and doesn’t have any of those niceties, so it’s handy to be able to quickly identify small syntax issues.', '.\n\nPlease note that there are multiple ways to obtain this result!\n\nThis can be done with several different tools. Try to use as many tools as you can.\n\n## 💾 Using Excel\n\nIf your SMILES consists of just a couple of atoms and bonds, you can construct it in Microsoft Excel itself. The Excel Chemistry Add-in has a function called `SMARTS()`. If you place an atom type, like “C”, into a cell, then drag and drop this cell into a new cell, that cell becomes a “COC1Cc2cCOc1NC1” SMILES. By combining the atoms, you can also achieve the desired SMILES.\n\n## 💾 Using OPSIN or RDKit Online\n\nYou can use OPSIN, a online cheminformatics toolkit.\n\n1. Open OPSIN by copy pasting this link (https://yassine-ghasr.github.io/oppsin/) into your browser.\n2. Click on “Cheminformatics”.\n3. Click on “SMILES”.\n4. Change the “smiles” field to this: CCOC1Cc2cCOC1NC1.\n5. Click on “convert”. A SMILES is shown in red.\n6. Click on “copy”. Paste the smiles into a text file.\n7. Verify the smiles with your molecular viewer.\n\n## 💾 Using RDkit\n\nDownload RDKit with this link. RDKit is a piece of cheminformatics software that you can install on your own computer.\n\n1. Open RDKit by clicking on the RDKit desktop icon.\n2. From the menu, choose “Conda Environment” -> “Open a new terminal” -> “Conda activate”.\n3. From the menu, choose “Tools” -> “RDKit”. The python prompt will appear, followed by three lines of text. Do not close the terminal window.\n4. From the menu, choose “File” -> “New SMILES”.\n5. Copy paste this code: CCOC1Cc2cCOC1NC1.\n6. Click on “New”. RDKit makes the desired molecule, and shows the code for that code in the “editor” window.\n7. Click on “Editor”. RDKit shows the desired SMILES.\n8. Click on “Copy”. Paste the smiles into a text file called smiles.txt.\n9. Verify the smiles with your molecular viewer.\n\n## 💾 Using KETCHI\n\n1. Install KETCHI by typing this code into the terminal: `conda install -c conda-forge -c conda-forge/label/cf202011 pyketchi` into the python prompt. The terminal window has to be open for step 6.\n2. From the menu, choose “Tools” -> “RDKit”. The prompt will appear, followed by three lines of text. Do not close the terminal window.\n3. From the menu, choose “File” -> “New SMILES”. The “new smile” window will appear. Insert the code: CCOC1Cc2cCOC1NC1. Then click on “New”, and the new SMILES will be shown in the editor window.\n4. Copy the smiles, as shown in the editor window, into a text file.\n5. Verify the smiles with your molecular viewer.', '\n\nThe algorithm you will use is based on the work of M.A. Hahn in ""A Stochastic Method for Random Generation of Organic Molecules."" The work can be downloaded for free from here.\n\nStart by downloading the SDF file for a molecule similar to the target here: SDF file containing target cpd.\n\nNext, add the following code to a new Python file. Note that a portion of this code is from the reference paper we provided.\n\nFirst, we will import the random module. We will use this module to select which atoms in the molecule we will add the new atom, as well as which atom and which group we will add. Then, we will import the SMIL. This library will be used to generate the SMILES code for the molecule. Next, we will create a list containing a tuple for all atoms in the starting molecule. Each tuple in this list will contain the atom ID, the atom type, and the atom coordinates. We will get this information from the target (which we will read with RDKit). In this line, we ask RDAtom to give me the atom ID, the element, as well as the X, Y, and Z coordinates.\n\nNext, we will create the new molecule, and name it mol_new - which is just a blank molecule containing only a central carbon atom. Now that we have the mol_new starting point to add new atoms to, we will declare which atom and which group in the molecule to add. Now that we know what atoms and groups we are dealing with, we can start adding atoms. To do so, we will add two more atoms to our random variable selection so we know which atom and which group to add the new atom to. We will do this in the for loop, and select the atoms we want based on their index value. In the first line of the for loop, we declare the atom we want to add the new atom to. Then, in the second line of the for loop, we declare which group to add an atom to. In the next line of code, we will use the random module to select which atom to add the new atom to, or which group to add a new group to. We will call the RDKIT Library.\n\nOnce we know which atoms and groups we are adding an atom or group too, we need to use these values to update the mol_new structure. This will take some time to get your head around, but here we are checking to see if there is a previous atom. We don\'t need to worry about whether or not previousGroup (an atom attached to the atom we are adding an atom or group to) exists, as it may not be there - it may not be connected to anything.\n\nIn the following lines of code, we are adding an atom to the atom/group we selected. First, we get the number of atoms/groups that are connected to the atom or group that we are adding our new atom or group to. This tells us which atom positions we need to add the new atom or group to.\n\nIn the following bit of code, we are adding a group to a group. First, we get the number of atoms attached to the group we are adding our group to, and use this information to decide which group positions in the new molecule mol_new we need to connect. Then, in the code below it, we tell RDKit to create an atom with the same atomic information as in the previous RDKIT Library. We also create these atoms in mol_new.\n\nNext, we will add the new mol_new structure we are making to the list.\n\nNow that we have made our new SMILE, the last thing left is to print the SMILES code in the final few lines of the code. We will set the SMARTIES flag here, which is used to flag an atom in the SMILES format as having multiple connections.\n\nIf you run the program, it should output something like this:\n\nSMILES is one of the most common representation schemes for organic molecules. It\'s not a chemical nomenclature system, but instead is a string of characters that represents the connections between atoms of the molecule.\n\nSMILES was first developed in 1986 by chemists Daylight Chemical Information Systems as a part of a more widespread push to standardize data and methods for computer searches in cheminformatics applications. There is now SMILES standard maintained by the IUPAC.\n\nSMILES have four broad rules. First, when two atoms are connected a simple hyphen is used to denote that connection. If they are connected by multiple bonds, the number will be in subscript after what is known as a ""stem"", which is the single hyphen. The second', '(C)CC\n\n14001\n\n# Question\n\nGenerate a molecule in SMILES format similar to this one:\nC_{15}H_{26}N_{6}O_{5} (C_{28}H_{53}Br_{2}Cl: C_{28}H_{53}Br_{2}Cl; C_{14}H_{12}O_{8}: C_{14}H_{12}O_{8})\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe SMILES format uses a graphical representation of chemical structures to specify a molecule as a sequence of bonds and atoms. In contrast to the chemical formula, SMILES indicates the actual bonding pattern of a molecule.\n\nSMILES representation\nCarbon: C\nHydrogen: H\nOxygen: O\nNitrogen: [NH] or N\nCl: Cl\nBr: Br\n\n### Rules:\n\n- For each bonding partner a number (up to 9) is specified that represents the amount it is bonded. It can be omitted if the number is one (e.g. CH_{4} can be written as C[H]).\n- If there is an aromatic ring, use - (e.g. cyclohexane can be written as C1CCCCC1).\n- Stereoisomers can be specified with R,S or cis,trans (e.g. cyclohexane can be written as c1ccccc1).\n- If there is a double bond it needs to be preceded by =.\n- If there is an aromatic ring, but no double bonds you need to precede the ring with c or C, if there is a ring with double bonds you need to indicate it with c#.\n- If there is a triple bond it needs to be preceded by = (e.g the molecule of cyclohexadiene can be written as C1=CC#CC1).\n\nBased on the provided example, the formula is C_{15}H_{26}N_{6}O_{5}. There are 6 Nitrogen atoms in the structure. Also there is an aromatic ring with a double bond (indicated by an =). So, the SMILES formula needs to start with [NH]ccc1cc([NH]ccc1)c1. Based on the rules above, the aromatic ring can be written as c1c2ccc2 (omitting the double bond as it is already written as =), while specifying stereoisomers. All remaining atoms need to be written in a sequential manner, starting with the chain at the aromatic ring (i.e. -CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-[NH]-C-[NH]-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C). The number of hydrogens can be omitted while writing the SMS and calculated by the computer, if the sum of the formula is correct. The final SMILES formula will look like: [NH]1c[NH]c[NH]cccc2cc2c[NH]2c1ccc1c(-C(C)CCC2)(CCc1CC3)CC(C)C\n\nMolecular formula - C_{28}H_{53}Br_{2}Cl: C_{14}H_{12}O_{8}\nThe formulae used a short-hand notation for the hydrogen atoms and omitted the remaining oxygen atoms.']",1.0,1.0,0.3277476769246249,7,1,1,"['O\n\n# SMILES\n\n## Description\n\nThis filter returns a string of SMILES for the molecule, based on a user-selected format (e.g. SMILES, InChI key, SMILES-IDs).

This is the case if you are running your notebooks directly on a PC with ChemDraw installed on your desktop (that’s not recommended since it’s difficult to share notebooks with others).\n\nA better way to run is to execute commands like this:\n\n`jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=<some_notebooks_dir>`\n\nThis will open a web browser and serve your notebooks from a specific directory located on the PC which hosts your Jupyter server. Another solution is to execute the following command:\n\n```\njupyter notebook --notebook-dir=<some_notebooks_dir> --no-browser\n```\n\nThis will open a terminal prompt which will be connected to the Jupyter server, but you will have a terminal prompt instead of a web browser for interacting with your notebook. This can be very convenient if you want to be able to edit your notebook files directly from a Vim or Notepad ++ and you want to run Python code through the notebook. This is a good solution if you want to build something like a GUI.\n\nA last solution is to use Wine or Virtualbox to install Linux and run your Jupyter notebook in it. This is the method which I’m recommending if your PC doesn’t have Python or ChemDraw installed (in addition it will reduce costs for using your computer). You can still access the web browser from your PC but you would run the notebooks in a virtual machine. If you run your Jupyter notebook from your PC’s command prompt, you can type the following command to access your notebook directory:\n\n```\nexplorer \\\\<your_virtual_machine_IP>\n```\n\nTo find out the IP address, you can type the following in the virtual machine’s command prompt:\n\n```\nifconfig eth0\n```\n\nFor example, if you get the IP address 10.0.2.15, when typing the above command, you can go to that IP with your web browser to access the Jupyter server.\n\n```\nexplorer 10.0.2.15\n```\n\n## Using Wine and a Virtual Machine\n\nIf you install Wine (version 3) or Virtualbox, you can then create a Linux machine and install the necessary software. To do this I recommend that you use the command line tools for Linux when running Linux on your physical machine (VirtualBox terminal). For Wine, you need Windows 7 SP1 installed. See the following link for instructions:\n\nAfter installing Wine, you need to install the libraries, because they are not included in the installation program. To do this, you need to install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, and the latest version of .NET, because not all libraries are included in the last version.\n\nThe following instruction can be used on Windows 10:\n\n```\nwget.exe https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/releases/x86_64/apk-tools/alpine-sdk-3.7-x86_64.rpm\ndpkg -i alpine-sdk-3.7-x86_64.rpm\nrpm2cpio alpine-sdk-3.7-x86_64.rpm | cpio -iv\napk.exe add wine\n```\n\nNote that when you copy the download link, the extension of the file may be .txt, so you must change it to .rpm before using the command. You can install the apk package manager by running the rpm2cpio command. You can then install wine using the following command:\n\n```\napk.exe add wine\n```', '\n\n### Question 1.1\n\n19.

Note that the first ""C"" is the starting point for the chain.\n\nLet\'s take a look at the given SMILES:\n\nCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1N1CCCCC1\n\nFrom the figure below, you can see how different segments are parsed:\n\nLet\'s look at how to parse the following bit:\n\nCS(=O)(=O)cc1\n\n1. The letter ""C"" in the SMILES is the first atom in the chain; atoms 2, 3 and 4 are the three atoms that follow with the connectivity between them.\n2. The atom 1 is the connecting atom of the heteroatom.\n3. The letter ""s"" before the atom 1 means that atom 1 is a double bond with the previous atom of the chain.\n4. The second letter ""O"" that follows the parenthesis is also double bonded with the atom above with a value of atomic number 6.\n5. From the third letter ""O"", we start the chain. Let\'s say this new chain is a sequence with new label ""s"". You have to note that there are two consecutive ""O"", which means double bond, then there is an ""O"", which means one carbon to be added to the chain before the atom 1. In short, there are two carbons with bonds to oxygen. Next, the letter ""c"" in the chain creates a single bond on the chain, and the letter ""c"" also creates a carbon with bonds to the chains ""c"" and ""s"" after the double bonds.\n6. The letter ""c"" that follows the parenthesis after the carbon chain segment represents a single bond. Note that all atoms in this line belong to the same chain.\n7. The letter ""1"" is the starting point of the heteroatom chain. In the present SMILES, the chain is only one carbon.\n\nOnce you understand this segment, you can now consider the following segment:\n\nc1ccc(N)cc1N1CCCCC1\n\nAgain, let\'s look at how to parse it:\n\nFrom the second letter ""c"" we start the chain. Let\'s say this new chain is a sequence with new label ""t"". You have to note that atom 2 is attached to oxygen via double bond and a carbon via single bond, which comes to atom 3. Next, the letter ""c"" in the chain creates a single bond on the chain and then a carbon with bonds to the chains ""s"" and ""t"" after the bonds.\n\nFrom the fourth letter ""t"" we start the new chain. In this chain, the first atom also comes to the oxygen as in the previous segment. In other words, this chain also starts double-bonded with oxygen, from atom 1, and then the following carbon has bonds to the carbon segment ""t"" and the next carbon. The following letter ""t"" also corresponds to the new chain.\n\nThe last segment of the string is the chain with a label ""t"". From the letter ""t"" we start the chain. In this chain, the first atom also comes to the oxygen, as in the previous segment. In other words, this chain also starts double-bonded with oxygen and then the following carbon has bonds to the carbon segment ""s"" after the bond. The last letter ""1"" is another way to indicate that all atoms in this line belong to the same chain. Therefore, this last chain represents the heteroatom with atomic number 16.', ""\n\nI did not add any braces to the smiles because I have never used one of these things before.\n\nThis is the molecule after the creation: [attachment=14161 image-6173-1291238501.png]\n\nNow the SMILES string below is one I had seen in a paper and it appears a few times in the paper.

If you input a SMILES string, this project creates a similar molecule.\n\nWhat is similar?

What is the significance?\n\n1) Answer: The molecule obtained by a simple variation of the original in SMILES format is CC(C)(C)c1cccCCCCSC(=CC=1O)N1C(=O)c1=NC(=O)NC=Cc2csc2c1cc2)cccc. The molecules were similar in molecular formula, number of atoms, and connectivity pattern but they had slight alterations and therefore they were completely different in terms of structure. The answer in correct SMILES format (CC(C)(C)c1ccc(-c2csc(NC(=O)CC#N)n2)cc1c2) for the compound obtained by simple variation was given by the students.\n2) Significance: The changes made in the molecule will help to study the impact of a variation on the structure of the molecule. The significance of the structure will tell about the changes and the effect to be examined and what are we going to get compared to the original structure. In the present example, two carbons have been replaced by 2 carbon and the nitrogen bonded to an oxygen and carbon were replaced by a sulfur and carbon.\n3) Conclusion: In the present example, one of the 2 possible ways of generating structurally similar molecules which were possible has been obtained and in the future, the other possible structure too could be obtained.\n\n#### Top Answer\n\n  The answer in correct SMILES...

The question includes two molecules written as SMILES: `Cc1ccnc(NC(=O)CCOc2cccc(C)c2C)c1O` (asparagines) and `Nc1cc3c(=O)Ocnc3cl` (cinnamic acid).\n\nThe tool Simbiole Simulations and Tools for Chemists contains four sections.

The second, Simulations and Tools, contains 13 subsections which run experiments, show SMILES generators, do chemical name generation, and find and evaluate molecular similarity.

The last, Extras, contains a number of programs like a molecular editor and a molecular renderer.', '=O\n\n#### The Mentor\'s Approach\n\nThere is no way to do this problem with a pencil and paper, since it would take hours to draw a long chain of connected atoms just to make a few carbon atoms. So if you haven\'t made the transition already, please learn a computer language before trying to solve this chemistry problem.\n\nBefore writing the program, there is another way to think through the problem. Using a piece of scratch paper, draw the atoms and bonds between the atoms. Make the molecule a little bigger and then look for a pattern in the molecule--are any of the bonds the same or similar? Try to figure out one section of the molecule that can be copied and moved to another place in the molecule. If you find an area that can be copied, do you know the code to do that action in your favorite coding language?\n\nOnce you have figured out the problem and know what sections of code to use, then it is time to write the code to solve the problem.\n\nIn writing your program, you first want to have a section of code to initialize the new structure. Then you want to use some kind of loop to repeat the pattern until you have used all of the pieces to make the new structure. Inside the loop, you can copy and move sections of the original structure to make the new structure.\n\nIn this case, I used the ChemDraw structure viewer to draw the original structure, then right clicked on the structure and choose the program menu to ""Save as SMILES."" Then I loaded that data file into the Code Studio app and copied the source code. Then I changed the original structure SMILES into a variable called original_smiles. Then I used split to break apart the original_smiles. Since there is a comma after every atom of the string, it was easy to break apart the string after every atom.\n\nThe main part of the code for this problem was to use the original_smiles string to put the bonds in the correct place. You needed to copy the bonds onto the right atoms. So I used the first letter of each bond in the original_smiles string and checked to see if they matched the atoms at the end of the code for the new string new_molecule. If they matched, I used the concat() function to paste the rest of the bond onto the matching atom. If the end atoms of the bond doesn\'t match any atoms in the new molecule, then you need to create a new atom and paste the bond to that new atom. In this problem, there was one bond that had a loop inside it. It had a section of code for the first part of the loop, then a comma, then there was a section of code for the middle part of the loop, then there was a comma, then there was a section of code for the end of the loop. You just needed to concatenate together the first part, then the comma, then the middle part, then the comma, then the back part.\n\nAnother thing to consider with the loop was that one of the ends of the loop had a different atom than the other end of the loop. So to keep the loop consistent, you had to set the carbon atom to be any one of the carbons in the middle of the loop.\n\n#### Coding in JS/P5.js/Sweet.js/AFrame\n\nAFrame has a component called a-link to provide you with a way to jump between different webpages.

It is: COCC(=O)CCCCNc1cccc(Cl)c1ClC(O)Cl. Unfortunately in the library we have only one molecule and there are no tetrahedral angles of 60° like in the starting molecule. This means that we have to find another molecule in which a substituent can be attached to a quaternary sp3 carbon. In this way we find the second molecule, CO(O)C(O)CC(Cl)=CC(Cl)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1ClC(Cl)Cl. It is very important that we find two tetrahedras of carbon containing four substituted carbon atom (four substituents) in order to use them in the search and in the following substitution.\n\nNow we generate a SMILES in order to make the substitution. Using a small library of SMILES, the SMILES of the molecule with four tetrahedras is  CO(O)COC(O)C(O)CO(O)CCOc1CC(Cl)=CC(Cl)NCC(O)CC(O)C(O)CC(Cl)=CC(Cl)n1cccc(Cl)CCl.\n\nThe following substitutions allow us to obtain the target structure in SMILES format COC(=O)CCCCNC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1ClC(O)Cl.

To take this analogy a step further I want to ask you, my dear readers, to help me out with a very specific challenge. Using a molecular modeling kit, please build this molecule:\n\nThis molecule consists of one benzocyclobutene (green) moiety with two amino-caprolactams (purple) attached to the ring. I also hope that you have a sense of humor. There are too many to answer, but with the advent of molecular modeling software we have an opportunity to ask for a more sophisticated representation. With this request I am introducing the first crowd sourced #ChemHumor project. As mentioned in previous posts there have been several instances where it would be nice to have a quick sketch of a common molecule.\n\nThis is a bit of a stretch. I thought that I would first post the SMILES code below. I wonder if you can come up with a molecule whose building moieties (fragments) can be replicated here: O=C(NCc1noc(-c2ccsc2)n1)c1ccc[nH]c1=O. Yes, I have put this out in the public domain. I do not think anyone who does not have access to a modeling software package will be able to answer or understand what is being asked here.\n\nMy SMILES string above is designed to replicate this structure.\n\nThe main body is a caprolactam derivative using the NC fragment which represents an amide group. From the caprolactam the two benzene rings are joined by an amide group as seen below. We can see that the benzocyclobutene ring is attached to a caprolactam ring that is flanked on both sides by benzene rings. The ring that is fused to the benzocyclobutene ring also has an amide connection. From the central caprolactam we have two carbon chains emanating from the N-terminals. We can see that the upper chain has a methyl group and the chain that is next to the benzocyclobutene does not have a substituent. Both of these chains are two carbons long.\n\nI do not know if this can be done with today’s state of the art molecular modeling packages since you can not have a disjointed carbon chain. I am not quite sure that ChemDraw can manage that. I will take a look at what ChemDraw does with a disjointed carbon chain.\nI am looking forward to seeing if it can be done and what your interpretation of this SMILES string would bring you. After all, I did not tell you what this molecule would look like, did I? It was up to you to figure out what that structure was!\n\nIf you like this post tune in regularly for more #ChemHumor posts. I will also be making some posts on Chemistry, Science and Education. Have a great Halloween and thanks for reading!', ', which is a potent enzyme inhibitor.\n\n#### Solution\n\n```\n## 0x26D8: A[0]=""Cc1cc2c(C(O)c3ccccc3F)c1""\n\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# A is the input SMILES graph with its nodes labeled\n# with characters and a key mapping the nodes from\n# characters into integers\ndef get_smiles_graph(smiles):\n  """"""\n  Return the SMILES string and the mapping of characters to nodes.\n  """"""\n  # Get the key to map the indices of the atoms to characters:\n  # A[0] is the original SMILES graph string, while A[1] is a\n  # dictionary of the indices into the nodes/labels in A[0].\n  A = smiles.Split()\n\n  return A\n\ndef get_new_molecule(smiles, new_molecule_length):\n  """"""\n  Given a target molecule, return a molecule the \'distance\' of\n  which from the target SMILES is least while remaining within an\n  arbitrary \'new_molecule_length\' of the target molecule.\n  """"""\n  # Get the mapping from the characters in the target molecule\n  # to indices in the graph\n  _, A = get_smiles_graph(smiles)\n\n  num_nodes = len(A)\n\n  # Get the length N of the target molecule:\n  N = smiles.Length()\n\n  print(""Distance range for target molecule: range: %d- %d) for ""\n        ""molecule of length %d:"" % (0, N-1, num_nodes))\n\n  # Generate the list of all the permutations of the atoms:\n  perm_list = []\n  for perm in itertools.permutations(A.keys()):\n    # Convert the permutation back to a string and check if\n    # it is a valid molecule:\n    S = [c for c, i in zip(smiles.Smiles(), perm)]\n    smiles2 = \'\'.join(S)\n    test_smi = SmiSimplify.IsValid(smiles2)\n    #print(""Permuted SMILES: "", smiles2)\n    if test_smi:\n      perm_list.append(perm)\n\n  # Get all permutations with a total of 4 covalent bonds\n  num_bonds = 0\n  four_bonds = [p for p in perm_list if num_bonds == 4]\n\n  # Use NP to find the closest SMILES:\n  NP.minimize(objfun=target_mol_fun, args = (smiles, num_bonds))\n\n  return smiles2\n\n# Input the target molecule SMILES\nsmiles = CCc1cc2c(C(O)c3ccccc3F)c1NC(=O)C2\nnew_molecule = get_new_molecule(smiles)\n\nprint(""Found the input molecule: %s"" % smiles)\nprint(""Found the new molecule: \\n%s"" % new_molecule)\n\n# Print out the SMILE string after canonicalization\nprint(can_smiles)\nprint(new_mol.Smiles())\n```']",,,,7,1,0,[],14.285714285714285,0.0

With the intention to develop an open-access text-based representation system that is sufficiently general to be applicable to any chemical substance, SMILES were conceived in the 1980s by David Weininger at the Molecular Design Labs (MDL)  to provide an “all-purpose” chemical description which is readable and writable by computer.\n\nSMILES are used for encoding and transferring chemical entity descriptions among different computer systems. SMILES representations can be generated automatically from the input of chemical structure descriptions, or they can be typed in through a simple text user interface by humans.\n\nHere are some samples : (SMILES)\n\nMol 1: S,C1=CC=C2C(=CC(=O)O)C(=CC(=C(C(Cl)(C)C)C(C)C(Cl)=O)=O)C1=C\n\nMol 2: C1CCCCCCC1\n\nMol 3: S,C=Cc1ccc(OC2cn(c12)c3cccc4=O)C(=O)n1C(=O)OC4\n\nMol 4: S(C1=C(C=C(C(Cl)(C)C)C(C)C(Cl)=O)=O)=O\n\nMol 5: COC1=CC=CC=C1', '\nCCc1ccccc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(c1CNc2N2CCN2)cc2\n\nThere are a lot of open sources in different programming languages that can help to produce new molecular graphs. Some examples are OpenBabel, RDKit, and CDK.\n\nThis challenge requires some knowledge of these open-source libraries, but once you get the handle of them, producing some new molecular graph should not be an issue.\n\nTo generate a new molecule using OpenBabel you need to use the following code:\n\n```\nfrom openbabel import pybel\n\n# This is where you should load the .sdf file that contains the original molecules\nmol_list = pybel.readfile(""sdf"", ""test.sdf"")\n\n# Generates the new molecule by modifying the original one based on probability distributions\nnew_mol = mol_list[0].generate()\n\n# This is where you should store the molecule\nnew_mol.write(""sdf"", outfile=""test.sdf"")\n```\n\nAn example of the code in Python with RDKit is the following:\n\n```\nimport sys\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Draw import MolToImage\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole\n\n# This is where you should load the .sdf file that contains the original molecules\nSmiles_list = [""CCn1ccccc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(c1CCNc2N2CCN2)cc2"", ""O=C(CSc1ccccc1Nc2ccccc2n2n2)n2c1cnncc"", ""COCCN(CC(=O)N(C)C)Cc1cc2ccccc2s1""]\n\n# Creates the new SMILES string\nnew_mol_smiles = Chem.MolToMolBlock(Chem.MolFromSmiles(Smiles_list[0]))\nAllChem.ReplaceSubstructs(new_mol_smiles, Smiles_list)\n# Generates a new molecule that will be added to the list\nSmiles_list.append(new_mol_smiles)\n# Iterates through the list of molecules and generates new ones based on probability distributions\nfor i in range(len(Smiles_list)):\n    for j in range(5):\n        new_Mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(Smiles_list[i])\n        AllChem.ReplaceSubstructs(new_Mol, [Smiles_list[i] for _ in range(5)])\n        Smiles_list.append(Chem.MolToMolBlock(new_Mol))\n# This stores the molecule\nwith open(\'output.sdf\', \'w\') as fout:\n    fout.write(MolToImage.MolToSmiles(new_mol))\n    fout.write(""\\n\\n"")\n```\n\nYou can use the following function to create graph by a reaction (only in RDKit):\n\n```\ndef graphMolByReaction(Smiles_list):\n    # Creates an array of reactions\n    reactions = []\n    # A dictionary with information on the products and reactants\n    products = {}\n    reactants = {} # reactant dictionary\n    # This function generates all possible products of the reaction\n    def getGraph(products, reactants):\n        # A dictionary with all the possible reactions from the given list of products\n        reaction = {}\n        for i in range(len(products)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(products)):\n                product = [reactant for reactant in reactants\n                           if reactant not in products[i] and reactant not in products[j]]\n                reactant = [reactant for reactant in products[i] if reactant not in products[j]]\n                reactant += [reactant for reactant in products[j] if reactant not in products[i]]\n\n                if len(product) != 0:\n                    # This is where you should load the .sdf file that contians the original molecules\n                    input_list = []\n                    Smiles_list = [""CCn1ccccc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(c1CCNc2N2CCN', '\nSmiles\nSmiles\nSmiles']",1.0,1.0,0.6770545444151863,7,2,2,"['\nO=S(=O)(Nc1cccc(CO)c1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1\n\nP.S., please, provide your answer within 12 hours.\nIf the task has a significant number of solutions, please, select only one solution and provide the corresponding SMILES string.\n\nThis is the data set', '\nc1ccccc1\n\nThe dataset contains 500 tuples (molecules), so you probably should not use all of them in the first try as it will slow down your computation significantly (each molecule will be a separate task inside a cell).

A SMILES string is a specific SMARTS pattern in which some elements are explicitly defined and others are not.\n3. For example,\n    1.\n    2. C:  :  is explicitly defined\n    3. ccccc: not explicitly defined\n4. This property is the same for both SMILES and SMARTS. It allows the patterns to be rewritten in a more readable form (by human beings) and to support variable substructure.\n5. If a character (e.g. c1) needs to be modified, it must be defined as non-canonical by explicitly preceding it by a %. For example: %C%c1CCCc1N. Use Rewrite SMARTS/SMILES to automatically rewrite the patterns.\n6. A pattern can use both canonical and non-canonical symbols.\n7. The program can generate new molecules based on a SMILES or SMARTS template.\nSome examples are given below. The results will vary depending on the version of the software installed.  Also, in some cases, the program might not find a template substructure and will terminate.', '7, 9-Dibromo-5, 7-dimethyl-1, 7-dioxo-3-phenyl-1,7-dihydro-spiro[bicyclo[3.4.0]heptane-1,4\'-cyclopentane]\nCs0c1ccccc2ncnc2C(=CC#N#C(N)C=C1c1Cc[C@H](NC(c2ccc2c2cccc1)NC(C)CC)Oc1ccc2)NC(C)CC - 2,2,2-Trimethyl-N-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-imidazolyl)hexane-1,5-dione\nCCCC(CC(C)C)C(CCC)CCC(C)C(CCCCC)C(CCCC)CC - 2-Methyl-5-methylenedecaprylidenehexanoate\nCaC1C[C@H](CCC2)CC(CCC(CC3)CC(C)C(C3)OC)C(CCC(CC3)CC(C)C(C3)CO)OC3 - (R,S)-1-Amino-4,6-dideoxy-5-octyl-6-thio-β-d-altros-hexose\nSMILES strings are un-ordered, flat representations of molecules. There are at least two methods of turning an SMILES string into a molecule by itself in R, the other of which is probably a better one for more robust applications of SMILES strings. The `mol` method will try to parse the SMILES to determine where brackets start and end. It then generates a molecular topology containing nodes corresponding to each atom in the SMILES. Finally, each node in its neighbourhood. The topology contains information on each atom, including its name, atom and chain type, aromatic information and charges, where appropriate, which can be used to generate a topology data frame. The `rxmol` method is probably more stable, and is used by SMILES packages like `smiles` (`smiles::mol2smiles()`) and (for conversion into smiles strings) in `chemmineR`. `rxmol` compiles the SMILES string into a formula using the rules in the `RxChem` package, and then uses Rx to perform a molecular reconstruction.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nmol(smls)\n```\n\n#### Arguments\n\n`smls`\n    An R data frame or a character vector representing SMILES strings of molecules to reconstruct. The data frame should have a single string column, or the characters can be supplied as a character vector. The character vector will be recycled to the appropriate length if the length is less than the number of rows.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\n\\dontrun {\nlibrary(""tidyverse"")\nlibrary(""RxChem"")\nlibrary(rxi)\nlibrary(""chemmineR"")\n#>\n#> Attaching package: \'chemmineR\'\n#> The following object is masked from \'package:tidyverse\':\n#>\n#>     as_tibble\n#> The following object is masked from \'package:stats\':\n#>\n#>     filter\n#> The following object is masked from \'package:base\':\n#>\n#>     filter\n\n# Generate an example SMILES using the OPSIN string\nmy_smiles <- mol2smiles(smiles_test)\n#> Warning in smiles_test$name: Character vector length is not equal to number of\n#> rows\n\n# Convert strings to data frame with only one column and drop NA\ndf <- data_frame(smiles = my_smiles) %>%\n    filter(is.na(smiles_check(smiles)) == FALSE) %>%\n    pull(smiles)\n#> Warning in data_frame(smiles = my_smiles): Character vector length is not equal to number of rows\n\n# This gets a single value out of data frame\nmol(df[1])\n#> $mol\n#>               MoleculeID  StructureID MoleculeID\n#> atom1       147889774964      <NA>     NA\n#> atom2       1466', '1.

Make a 2D representation: 1. Make a 3D representation: 1. Optimize: 1. Minimize:\n\n### Knowledge Base\n\n- ### What does the atom and number in the brackets after a substituent indicate?\n\nThe atom and number in the brackets indicate the number of atoms between the substitiuted atom and where it is attached. e.g. CCC(Br)=O indicates the bond between the two carbons should be 2 atoms.\n- ### What does [2,2] between a substituent indicate?\n\nThis means there should be two atoms between the substituent and the point where the substituent is joined and that the substituent will be orthogonal to the attached chain. It is represented as [2,2] in a bond line system, or [2,2] in a ring system.\n- ### What does [1,2] between a substituent indicate?\n\nThis means there should be one atom between the substituent and the point where the substituent is joined and that the substituent will be orthogonal to the attached chain. It is represented as [1,2] in a bond line system, or [1,2] in a ring system.\n- ### What does [2,1] between a substituent indicate?\n\nThis means there should be two atoms between the substituent and the point where the substituent is joined and that the substituent will be co-planar to the attached chain. It is represented as [2,1] in a bond line system, or [2,1] in a ring system.\n- ### Does the first line of SMILES always represent the complete molecule?\n\nNo. The first line of SMILES is merely a convenient way to represent the rest of the molecule using single letter abbreviations. e.g. The molecule CCC(CCCCC)=CCCC has the SMILES:c1ccc2(c3cccccc3)c2cccc1\n- ### Can I add comments to SMARTS or SMILES strings?\n\nNo. You can only add comments to molecules that have already been made from SMARTS or SMILES strings. This is because a comment in SMARTS or SMILES will be treated as an actual character and will therefore invalidate the string.\n- ### Why are there so many variations of a SMARTS/SMILES string?\n\nNot all SMARTS or SMILES strings are the same. This is because you can use an array of characters that represent the same thing, e.g. you can use b|c to represent the bond between two carbon atoms and [1,2]|[2,1]|[1,2] to represent a bond between a carbon and an attached atom. When using arrays of atoms to represent bonds you can change the end character in the array to indicate an array of double bonds.\n- ### How do I represent a hydrogen when adding a substituent within a SMARTS/SMILES string?\n\nYou must either represent the substituent as an array of characters or add a hydrogen to the atom adjacent to the substituent. An example of representing a substituent using an array of letters (a, b, c) is: c1cc(a),c(2),b2c3ccccc3o2 and an example of adding hydrogen is: CCOc2ccccc2C(=O)c1ccC\n- ### How do I represent a double bond within a SMARTS/SMILES string?\n\nYou simply use the character ! to represent a double bond, an example is: C(=O)\n- ### How do I represent a ring within a SMARTS/SMILES string?\n\nTo represent a ring within a SMARTS/SMILES string, you use the character c to represent carbon, an example is: c1c2c3cc1ccc(c)c3c21\n- ### What is the difference between SMILES and SMARTS?\n\nSMILES is a string of letters that represents a molecule, which can then be expanded to represent all the analogues of that molecule. The basic function of SMILES is to represent a molecule in the same way as chemical drawings. SMILES, for this reason, has two main purposes: - It allows you to easily represent the structure of a single molecule without the hassle of drawing it out each time, and to show how a molecule is connected.

A motif lacking a nitrogen (N atom)\n2. A motif lacking a CN (carbon, nitrogen, or other) motif.\n\nSo, if we want to change ‘the same’ kind of molecules as in this particular series, we will need to start from there.  If, for instance, we make a new 2-carbon-2-nitrogen motif, then we could make something that fits in the general series (see the compound above).

If I start to make a compound with a 2-carbon-2-nitrogen motif, and then I change a nitrogen in the molecule, the pattern I am creating is the same as before.\n\nThere is no reason to make a compound with a 2-carbon-2-nitrogen motif.  But, if that motif can fit into any molecule, then our new molecule must not share that specific motif with these compounds.

SMILES notation is used by many software programs for chemical structures.  In SMILES, the atoms are listed in the most common sequence, beginning with the carbons and working from left to right.  The bonds are implied in the notation and are always placed on the left side of the atoms to which they are connected without any arrow.  Some functional groups require additional information to completely specify the molecule.  Carbons are denoted by the symbol C.  The Oxygen atom will be denoted by O in SMILES.  The hydrogen atoms are understood and are not needed.  The single bond is not implied for bonds between the carbon and oxygen and are indicated by a dash “-“.  The double bond is indicated by “=”.  Double bonds between carbon and carbon are denoted by “:”.  The Nitrogen is denoted by N.   It does not need parentheses.  The Nitrogen bonded directly to carbon is the only Nitrogen that doesn’t need parentheses.  If a number is entered before a carbon, it means a substituent group, a functional group, or a ring.  All ring structures have numbers and must be within parentheses. The parentheses are used to denote rings and repeat units.  If a ring only has two atoms, it has a bond connecting them.

This should guide you on how to design the molecule by keeping in mind the following in mind:\n- When there appears to be different sets of ring structures connected to the same central ring; make sure NOT to change the set of rings, as in the examples above.\n- It is easier to synthesize a molecule without a chiral center. However, you must keep in mind the stereo center that is present in the molecule that you wish to design.\n\nIn the example, above, only one of the two structures on the left has the same substitution on the stereo centre as well as the correct substitution in the other structural patterns. Therefore, you must select the structure that has those two substitutions correct on both the correct set of 5-membered rings and on the other structural patterns in the series. You would then make the appropriate modifications to the substituents in the molecule that you have chosen as the scaffold.\n\nOnce you have selected the correct scaffold, make sure that the substitutes in the structure that you want to synthesize are compatible with other structural patterns of the series. In example (3) of the series in the questions, there are two possibilities to choose from.\n\nIn addition to understanding the patterns in the series, you also need to be comfortable making isomers and stereomers. For example, if your structure already had a bond-rotation problem, then you\'d need to use the ""R"" symbol to denote that bond to make it work. You can also go ahead and add stereomers to your structures if you need to do so in order to comply with a structural pattern.', '\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nThe key parts of this family of molecules can be described in this general way:\n\nThe first step would be to find a template that has the basic structure found in these molecules, except that we don’t want to use the heteroatom-containing (heteroaromatic) ring – we want to replace this ring with a set of six-membered carbon rings:\n\nThere are three approaches we could use at this point to create the molecule:\n(a) start with the template and build from there, or\n(b) start with the individual parts and put them all together\n(c) copy one of the molecules as a template and replace the rings with the carbon rings\n\nStarting from the template and building up would require building the new rings (two carbons and two nitrogen atoms), the amides, and the ester.  We would also have to build the aromatic ring (six carbons and a functional group, such as a nitrile).  The aromatic ring is particularly challenging: it would have to be set to a specific geometry in the final reaction.  The amide(s) would need to be set to a particular angle, as would be the ester and the nitrile.\n\nCopying one of the existing molecules as a starting point and changing the heteroaromatic rings to carbon rings would probably be easiest.  We would need only to make one carbon-carbon single bond and we would need new torsion information (rotational bonds) to set the new rings’ geometry.  The most challenging part would be finding the correct substituents for the aromatic ring because it is not clear what functional group is appropriate to create as a substructure, but this is easily addressed by simply adding in different atoms that will ultimately change to rings.\n\nStarting with the parts and putting them together (or, assembling them) may be easiest: we can use the same building blocks that we used to build our template structure, we can add atoms easily, and we do not need to make rings.\n\nSince we are dealing with six-membered rings, it seems an ideal choice to build with carbocycles – these are also easy to add to a structure using the ‘M’ commands in OMJ: (i) click near the bond where you want the new ring to be formed – in this case, we want the ring to be connected to a cis ring, so it is important to make certain to click on the correct bond (in this case, we want to avoid clicking anywhere near the other rings), and\n(ii) choose the appropriate atom type (in our case, we would choose a carbocycle)\n\nIn the following drawing, we start by adding an ‘Mn’ on the cis-ring with a carbon chain to allow the new ring to be added to the cis-ring.  This drawing doesn’t have to be pretty, just useful.  By clicking on this next to one of the carbons, we can create our new ring:\n\nTo complete our starting molecule, we need to add an ester (‘Mc1=’), a nitrile (‘Mcn1’), and a cis connection back to the other half of the molecule (‘Mn1’).  We could then add a methyl (‘Mn1CC’) or an oxygen (‘Mn1COc1’) to the aromatic ring.\n\nOnce we have our ‘starting molecule’, the final steps are to select an appropriate heterocycle (three carbons, two nitrogens) and orient it properly (as shown below), add new chiral centers to get the amine and amide groups to turn, and finally to connect the two halves of the molecule together.  This allows us to copy the new molecule and move it, rotate it, and then paste it into the template structure.\n\nOnce everything is in place, and it matches the starting template structure, we then have our ‘new molecule that could potentially fit within this series’:\n\nSMILES for this molecule is simply the template structure with our new ring substituted in\n\nThe final steps are to (i) check the SMILES for the ‘template’ molecule to make certain it is correct, (ii) copy/paste or type the SMILES string for the ‘new molecule’ into the template, and (iii) click ‘Build’.  The result is our new structure that resembles the other molecules in the series:\n\nNote 1: The nitrile is not easily drawn.  For molecules that use the ‘NcCn’ command, this does not cause a problem, although the nitrile ends up at a specific angle in our', '\n\nThe examples we have seen so far all have SMILES strings with 4, 5 or 6 bonds in a row, so this new entity also contains that number.\n\nIn our example above,\n\nCH3CH=CHCH3\n\nthe C-H bonds are omitted, because they are assumed by default (the convention is that double bonds are shown as R, RR is used in place of RR and RRR). Therefore the SMILES string above is equivalent to\n\nCCCCR[nH]=CRR[nH]=CRR=CR[nH]=CRR=CR[nH]=CRR=CR[nH]\n\nwhere we have written the single C-H bonds that we omitted. The new compound with a similar structure is obtained by replacing the C-H bonds by O atoms, thus\n\nCCCCRO(=O)RO(=O)RO(=O)RO(=O)RO(=O)RO(=O)RO(=O)ROC', '\n\nThe first ring of the molecule is the benzene system, this will always have 6 carbons!

All of the above rings form the main carbon backbone within the molecule. If we look at the side groups, we will find a carbonyl group, a methyl group, 1-2 hydrogens, sulfur, chlorine and 1-2 fluorines.

Instead, describe the overall structural or functional relationship between the various group. For example, in the case of the following families of compounds, only ONE structural description is required. Just make it clear that a series of compounds are described:\n- The SMILES string for a compound should only contain carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and single bonds. The SMILES for each of the remaining elements should be explicitly written. For example, for CO_{2}, each substructure would be represented as a SMILES code:\n- Explicitly indicate that a specific element, such as , is present on the carbon atom directly bonded to the specific functional group or substructure to which it is attached. That is, to represent:\n- To represent chloroethylphosphonic , use the SMILES:\n\n- When representing a functional group and its stereochemistry, follow the guidelines used in representing the atoms, bonds, and stereochemistry of chiral molecules (see: A.C.3.ii). When describing stereocenters at the beta-carbon of a carbonyl (C=O) group, the lowercase ""r"" and ""s"" are not appropriate for SMILES (since R and S reflect the absolute configuration). Instead, use the SMILES “” to represent the stereocenter at the beta-carbon of a formyl (C=O) functional group. If there is no stereochemistry, use the unspecified stereochemistry SMILES:', '\nCC(=O)NC1CCCN(C(=O)CSc2nc(C)cs2)C1\nCC(=O)NC1CCCN(C(=O)CSc2nc(C)cs2)C1\n\nIn the examples given, a commonality in structure is the β-oxo moiety, which is the β-substituent of a carboxylic acid (R^{1}-C-O-C-R^{2}). With the exception of the first molecule, which could be considered a cyclohexanol acetate, all of the structures contain a carboxylic acid. This allows you to begin a systematic search of the molecules within the SMILES strings and identify substructures that would allow for new possibilities.

In the last two molecules, the carbon that forms part of the aromatic rings has been changed with chlorine.\n\nIn order to design a molecule that would be able to form an aromatic ring, the oxygen or carbon must also be changed.\n\nSince chlorine can replace carbon, its chlorine can be attached using the atom-bond numbering system:\n\n-C(Cl)OO[C]C=C(O)NCCCCO(Cl)C\n\nThe oxygen is attached to both rings, the last oxygen is attached to only one ring, the first carbon attached to an oxime is not the only group attached to that carbon, and the first carbon is attached to a nitrogen.\n\nThe oxygen atoms can be modified so that all atoms are attached to the carbon or nitrogen.

This modification entailed the following five steps:\n\n1. Change the element type of sulfur (S) to phosphorus (P).\n2. Delete the stereocenter at the phosphorus atom.\n3. Change the type of the ring-carbonyl carbon from a sp3 to a sp2 hybridization.\n4. Rotate the bonds of the ring carbon to form a 2-membered ring configuration between the first adjacent pairs of attached carbons.\n5. Remove all formal hyrdrogens.\n\nThis modification to the SMILES string allows the correct, novel, SMILES string to be entered as the final answer:\n\nCC(P)NNCCCCCN1N=CN=N1\n\nA more complete description of the correct answer follows below.\n\nThis problem involved adding a P phosphorus atom to the original molecule. The new P atom was placed next to C1. In order to accommodate this change, the S atom next to C1 was converted into a P atom. In order to facilitate the rotation of the stereocenter with the new phosphorus atom, the original stereocenter was deleted. This stereocenter, by default, was assigned as being trans (t) to the phosphorus atom, however if this was not the case, the “t” stereocenter could have been entered as an “e” stereocenter to change the configuration from trans to cis (e). After the atoms and bonds were changed, the bond configurations were optimized using the Draw Panel of the Molecular Software System. This optimization changed the stereocenter configuration to a 2-membered trans ring. This step also changed the sp3 carbon to sp2 hybridization state. Next, each formal hydrogen was removed from the molecule to reveal the final correct answer to the problem. The completed molecule that resulted from these modifications follows:\n\nC(CCCl1N=CN=NCl1)(P)NNCCCCCN1N\n\nThis molecule contains both a P phosphorus and a nitrogen N atom. These two elements have the same electronegativity value of 3.0. Therefore, an anionic, two-coordinate, P-N atom pair exists in the molecule. Based upon the hybridization states of phosphorus and nitrogen, each has the ability to be involved in two bonding interactions while having two unpaired electrons which allow for the formation of an n-pair donor bond to each other (i.e. a P-N double-bond). In addition, it was determined that the molecule was comprised of two rings. The smaller ring of the molecule contained five atoms and was comprised of three double-bonds. The larger ring contained nine atoms, contained one double-bond, and four single-bonds. Thus, it can be determined from these molecular parameters that the correct solution to the problem above is a P-N double-bond.', ""\nNc1cc(OC(=O)N23Cc3ccccc4c(N5C(C5C5=C)C)ccccc4)ccc1NN\n\n\nSOLUTION:\nChemcraft code for drawing new molecule:\n'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\CHEMCAF.exe' 'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\draw.cst'\n'0:001.smi' 'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\smi\\\\0:001.smi' '10' '0:001.rst'\n'0:002.smi' 'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\smi\\\\0:002.smi' '10' '0:002.rst'\n'0:003.smi' 'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\smi\\\\0:003.smi' '10' '0:003.rst'\n'0:004.smi' 'C:\\\\CX117P\\\\smi\\\\0:004.smi' '10' '0:004.rst'\n\nMolecule code:\n1.

The first software package to implement SMILES was written by Chris Reeves in 1988.\n\nThe basic SMILES syntax represents atoms as atomic symbols enclosed by parentheses, with brackets used for ring members. The bonding is represented by connect-the-dots links with the starting and ending points of each bond labeled with a number. Bond types are only indicated for hetero atoms: for example, carbons are not specified but could be assumed if needed. Hydrogen and double bonds use zero as the label, and triple bonds are capped by a number sign. The default bonding state (sp^{3}) may be specified at the end of the chain with a state designator. For example, the isobutyl and isoprene fragments of the compound shown would be represented as c1cc1, and c1(c)ccc1 respectively.\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\n## Is the molecule a new, chemically synthesizeable compound?\n\nThe answer is based on some quick checks like:\n\n1. the molecule is non-aromatic, has fewer than four unpaired electrons, and a reasonable mass;\n2. it does not violate valency rules (atoms have an integer valency, and the total number of valency electrons in the molecule is equal to the pairwise sum);\n3. the valency is at about the right value for known inorganic salts;\n4. the molecular formula consists of elements that are known to be combined in the periodic table.\n\nIt is not really any of these that is necessarily important, just that certain properties indicate it is in a chemically allowable region of compositional space.\n\nBased on the above mentioned checks, the molecule looks like a realizable compound.\n\nMolecules without valid SMILES\n\n```\nO=C(CC1CCNC1)NC1CCC1(F)CCC1\nN1C1CC(=OO)NC2C(=C3)OC\nNCC(=O)Nc1nc(c2nc(C)cc2ccc2)n3c2cccnn3c1\nC(=O)CCNc1cn(c3cc(N#N)CC)cnc3Ccc(C)c2nc1\nNC1C=C2)CCCC1OC(C(OO)C)=O\nCN1C(C2C/4NC3=NC4C)C2C/4NC3=NC4C\nCCN1C(N)C2)(C3CCCCCC)C=C4)(C3C(C5CCCCC)C5=C6)C(C3)CCCC2)(C2)C=C1\n```\n\nPlease note: the molecule must not contain atoms that have to be replaced with hydrogens.\n\n## Is the molecule drug-like?\n\nThe molecule should ideally satisfy the following Lipinski principles:\n\n- No more than 5 hydrogen bond donors;\n- No more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors;\n- LogP ≤ 5; in practice, we would generally restrict logP to be between -3 & 4 log units;\n- Molecular weight ≤ 500.\n\nHere is a short explanation about each requirement:\n\n- Hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). For a HBD to contribute significantly, the oxygen or nitrogen atom needs to be directly attached to an atom that is electronegative enough to form a bond — typically the HBDs must have the groups CX_{3} or CX_{2}X, and the atom X should be oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. An HBD is also associated with fluorine as F-CH, F-CH_{2}, F-CH_{3} or F-C.\n- Hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs). Hydrogen bond acceptors are oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur, including those combined in a ring system only if the HBA functionality', '\n\n1. The first step in designing a novel molecule is to begin with a set of known molecules.\n2. The next step is to identify any common structural features amongst the existing molecules, such as their chemical formulas or functional groups.\n3. Based on the common structural features, a new molecular design can be proposed that incorporates all or some of the structural features from previous molecules while also introducing new elements. The new molecule can then be evaluated for its synthesis and stability using various databases and programs.', '\nCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C(=O)N(C)C1CCc2ccccc2CCCn1c(SCC(=O)c2ccc(CC)cc2)n[nH]c1=O\n\n\nThe dataset comprises a mixture of known commercially available molecules as well as synthetic molecules that have appeared in the past 5 years.

It consists of molecules from different collections including ZINC, PubChem, DrugBank, and ChEMBL.

If you are interested in making a heterocyclic, choose a molecule with a heterocyclic; if you want a molecule with a specific functional group, pick a SMILES with that group)\n\nStep 2: Change the functional group (if the starting SMILES has many functional groups, choose one that you do not want to appear in the final molecule).\n\nStep 3: For substituents (such as R and R1; R2 and R3) that appear in this SMILES, make substituents such as the one of interest to you or that do not contain any functional groups of interest. If none of the mentioned methods are viable, change the atom(s) or fragment(s) that are in the starting SMILES to ones that can be a substituent on that specific atom or fragment.\n\nStep 4: Check to see if the above molecule is correct.

There are many tools available to answer those questions.\n\nThe molecule also needs to conform to the following:\n\n- It must be synthesizable. No element of the molecule can be part of a ring made of only two atoms with no other ring containing them. For example, Br on N, as in N(Br1Br) isn’t valid.\n- Hydrogen is allowed, but must all be explicitly assigned to C, O, or N. (This rules out molecules such as [HNH].)\n- Must have at least one hydrogen.\n- Must contain at least three non-hydrogens. These include heteroatoms (C, N, O, P), as well as halogens (F, Cl, Br, I).\n- All chirality must be specified – the chiral atoms must be assigned a chirality center, and any asymmetric atoms must be made chiral centers as well. That is, the following two compounds are not valid:\n\n1. The only aromatic ring in the molecule can contain at most one fused ring consisting of only one non-C atom other than the fused ring itself.\n2. There can be no more than three rings, and there can be no two rings directly connected to each other. Also, two rings, both of which have a non-C atom in the ring, can contain at most two C atoms in common, but those two C atoms cannot be adjacent.\n3. The maximum total number of non-hydrogen atoms is three. This is why there can be only three rings; every ring introduces at least one non-hydrogen atom.\n\nFor example:\n\nNc1cccc1\n\nN\n\nand\n\nC(O)c1cccc1\n\nis invalid – it has four rings.\n\nC(O)CC(C(C)C)OC\n\nis invalid because of the double bond.\n\nand\n\nNc1cccc1C1CC1\n\nis valid. In addition, the following are valid:\n\nNc1cccc1Cc1C(Cc1)=NC1\n\nNc(C[H](CC)C)CC1=O\n\nNcc1ccccc1C\n\nNc1cccc22Cc1NCC2CCCc1c(cc2)c1(OC)c3n2n(CCC3)c(=O)c(c4[n+]13[n+]c2cc4O)c4\n\nThis competition is designed to be as difficult as you are interested in making it – there’s no benefit to adding more complexity, but if you want to have more fun you can add it.\n\nThe score is based just on the size of the molecule (SMILES). The size is based on the number of different non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule (C, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I) and its complexity, which is just based on the number of rings. The more different non-hydrogen atoms, the higher the score.\n\nThere are many many tools to validate SMILES strings, so I expect most participants to use those. In the same vein, if you are using a tool to generate SMILES strings, you also have to use it to check the validity of your SMILES string.\n\nIf your molecule validates properly but you’re not sure it’s new, run it against https://zenodo.org/record/4089891#.YGmW7mV17i0 – if more than 20 of them have the same SMILES, it probably is valid.\n\nIf the tool you’re using is missing, create a bug report (this is my issue tracker), along with a SMILES string that it doesn’t validate, and I’ll get it working.\n\nYour SMILES strings will be automatically validated and scored every minute for 42 hours.\n\nFor example, here’s a valid molecule:\n\nIts SMILES is Cc1nnc(c2cc1SCC(Cc3ccccc3)cCC2CcC(N1)CC3)O.\n\nIf you want to submit this SMILES to be validated, run it through https://smi2.io/#_= – it’s easy to copy/paste.\n\nFor this submission,', 'any other text submitted will count as incorrect.\nSubmission of any molecule already seen by the server or of invalid SMILES strings will be penalized (see scoring for more details). Do not forget about the following restrictions!\n\n- A molecule must contain at most 13 heavy atoms (i.e., excluding hydrogens).\n- A molecule must fulfill the following requirements (check the detailed description of the rules):\n- A drug-like molecule should not be a salt which has a net-charged ion.\n- A drug-like molecule should not contain a free covalently bonded metal atom. See the description of the possible exceptions and the list of permitted metal atoms.\n- A drug-like molecule should not be a high-ring molecule with more than 9 rings in a molecule.\nScoring\n\nPoints will be given for each molecule submitted by a user. Every valid molecule which is submitted for the first time will get 10 points. A valid molecule could be a drug-like molecule or a drug-like moiety (i.e., a part of a drug-like molecule that is an isolated, mono-functional functional group). Submission of a drug-like molecule or a valid drug-like moiety will also gain 0.5 points per additional atom (which means that a drug-like molecule composed of 8 heavy atoms will have the score 11, and not 10).\n\nIf a user submits a molecule that already has been seen (i.e., previously submitted by any user), the score is reduced by 50%. If a user submits an invalid SMILES string, the score is reduced to 0.

However, most chemists prefer to describe an organic molecule by means of an isomeric chemical formula. A chemist would define a given molecule by means of a line structure, called the Chemical Formula. A Computerized version of this formula (i.e. a Linear Formula) is called an SMILES.\n\nAs for the Linear Formula, the SMILES is also composed of three elements, i.e. atom elements, atom connections, and functional groups. This is different to the way in which it is displayed.\n\nIn a SMILES, atoms are represented by an alphabetical single letter abbreviation, and the atom connections are represented by a simple line.\n\n## How to find out SMILES from simple molecules\n\nLet me describe the SMILES of a simple molecule, such as methane CH4:\n\nC is an abbreviation of the carbon atom. The single line connecting the H atoms to carbon shows that hydrogen is a first-order neighbour element. You will find out that the simple formula or SMILES is represented by C-H, C-H, etc.\n\nIn a more complex formula, the atoms are represented by acronym abbreviations: H-C is the bond between a hydrogen and carbon atom; C-C is the bond between two carbon atoms; C=O is the double bond; C-C-C-O-C indicates four carbon atoms and an oxygen atom, etc.\n\nHowever, there are certain special cases that appear in complex SMILES. One of these is the SMILES of OCCN: the letters CO show that the oxygen atom is conjugated, not merely connected to the atoms that form the first line.\n\nIn cases where the atom is not directly linked in the first line, a single-letter symbol is added to the first line, such as HCO-H, H-CC-H, etc.\n\nAnother interesting situation is the case when two atoms are linked in the primary line with other neighbouring elements or atoms. The atom connection in the second line is denoted by the first two letters of its symbol.\n\nExample:\n\nThe SMILES CH2=CH2 indicates a chemical compound in which the methylenic carbon atom (CH2) is connected to two additional ethylenic carbon atoms (CH2=CH2). There is an additional rule: if a particular atom is present in the first line more than once, that atom is mentioned only once and is accompanied by the number one. There may also appear a combination of a number with a letter indicating a certain atom in that line.\n\nExample:\n\nThe SMILES represents the chemical formula CH2 = CH - CH2 = CH2 .\n\nThe most important special cases occurring in SMILES refer to cyclic molecules, and are differentiated according to their carbon atom rings:\n\nThe SMILES for the chemical formula OCN(CH3)2 - CH3  is [H1H]OC(=O)N(CH3)C(=O)C(C(=O)C#C)\n\nHence, it is extremely important that you try to understand how SMILES work by experimenting with their use.\n\nIn addition, I would like to draw your attention to their structural complexity.\n\nA good example is the SMILES of the following ring-structure: C1COC2=C1C(=O)=CC(=O)C=C(C=O)COC2 - CCC1=C(O)COC=C1=O\n\nIn order to understand how to form the SMILES of complex molecules in the simplest way possible, read and follow the rules for using the SMILES. You should also bear in mind that the same chemical compound can have more than one SMILES, each representing a specific structural configuration.\n\n##', 'No molecular drawing.\n\nThis is a chemistry problem:  It is an open question, not a solved problem.\n\n## Solution\n\nIt’s the benzene ring on Carbon number atom 3.

MMSeg is a 3D-to-3D deep learning model for segmentation of volumetric data, optimized for a medical environment. We have used MMSeg for medical data and in biomedical research as well. It has shown excellent performance on images of high-quality resolution, but has had a very important problem – the processing time of its segments is very slow, up to several minutes. We use the most modern tools and approaches in MMLeg, developed specifically for the MMSeg application. There are two MMLeg versions: GPU and CPU. GPU uses the latest Nvidia Titan X and Cuda 7. GPU version is faster than CPU, but less accurate. GPU version is about 30% slower in the performance of MMLeg, compared to the CPU. We tested GPU and CPU for different numbers of objects on different images, and we have made a few conclusions. GPU was the fastest at processing the smallest objects on the smallest images.\n\n## How to find the best dating sites?\n\nThis was also the first in-house solution that was built around this method. I built a small team to test this out. I had one developer, and we had two developers. The first time through, we got an email saying that there were no emails to respond to in our emails. We had a huge problem. So, we needed to start developing in a way that was more realistic. I told them, “OK, you’re going to have to go down the road to see how real this is going to be.” This is a game changer for all of us. We tried it out on a small scale with a couple of hundred people. That’s when I realized this was a game changer. It was the beginning — the game changer — right there. This is really a game changer. We are building out from this foundation where we are a team of 30 and have built out a software platform for all of us. We are not going to have a team of 30 people and a little bit of support. We have a software platform, and we need to support it. Our software platform is built around this thing called the API. API is short for Application Programming Interface. We use the API for everything, so if you look at it from the outside, it looks like it’s just a database, but once you start writing it out, you’ve got to think of a different programming language, a different language with a different set of functions, that you’re going to have to use. APIs are what we call the “application program interfaces.” They are what you use to create web applications and do a job. The API is what you use to do everything. You don’t have to write your own application. You can use APIs that are already out there and then extend them to do what you want to do in your own way. This is one of the first projects ever to use APIs from other people. These are our APIs that we’ve used. And all of our other systems, we use APIs and extensions to our own API, so we’re not building out our own web applications. Our API is built for everybody. That’s actually really cool in a lot of ways. That really made us look at how it was built, and it made us look at what it would be like for our users. And it really made it possible to do things we couldn’t do before and make them more usable for our users. It really made us really think about why our software might be a different kind of software. It took us to a different space, and it made us think about why it might have to be a different type of software. We’re still going through our software phase in terms of what we do. I know there’s a lot of people that think\n\n## Why Online Dating?\n\nI have been dating a very cute guy for about 4 months now and I am starting to like him.

In each case, the molecule on the left is to be mapped into the SMILES string on the right.\n\nMolecule 1:\nMolecule 2:\nMolecule 3:\nMolecule 4:\n\nThe SMILES code for the molecule is\n\nIn this case, the SMILES code for each atom is the same. It turns out that we can construct this molecule using one of the five permutations of the following atoms.\n\nAtom 1\nAtom 2\nAtom 3\nAtom 4\nAtom 5\nWhich are exactly the five symmetric permutations possible.\n\nLet’s see how they are put together. What matters are just their positions, so if we draw them as dots and put arrows between two dots going to the same side, we see how one can go from Atom 1 to Atom 2, … .\n\nThe next step is to translate this information into SMILES code. We will use upper case letters A, G, I, K, M to represent the five atoms and then will add numbers in parentheses to indicate positions; A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 in Atom 1, etc.\n\nFor example, the position of the Oxygen in Atom 1 indicates which carbon is attached to it, so let’s define the following atoms and positions:\n\nThe three atoms in Atom 1 are:\nA-h.g = A123;\nA-H.I = A124;\nA-i.K = A135.\nNext, we put this information into a SMILES code: A1-C(=O)C(C123124)C(C135)O.\n\nPart II: The next problem involves getting from the two dimensional representation into the SMILES code in one step. Again, we will look at this problem in two dimensions.\n\nEach of the five atoms has three bonds, each bond connecting two atoms. Each connection connects two atoms, one on the left and one on the right. An example of this can be seen below in this two dimensional representation of the molecule in part 1.\n\nUsing this information, let’s fill in the atoms in Atom 1.\n\nLet’s assign the following atoms.\n\nA – Atom 1 in the top left corner, the atom that is connected to the Oxygen in the top row of the top left corner, and the atom that is connected to the Oxygen in the Oxygen column\nH – The atom that is connected to the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the top right corner\ng – The atom connected\nI – The atom connected to the hydrogen and oxygen atoms on the left side\nK – The atom connected to the hydrogen and carbon atoms on the right side\nM – The atom connected to the oxygen and carbon atoms on the bottom side\n\nOnce we’ve filled in the atoms, we can fill in the positions for the atoms just the way we did in part 1.\n\nOnce we’ve filled in both Atom 1 and Atom 2, we can fill in the atoms of Atom 3:\n\nWith the atoms of Atom 4:\n\nAnd finally, the atoms of Atom 5:\n\nThe last step is to look at the molecule in two dimensions and map it into a SMILES code in one dimension.', '\n\n$\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{N}$\n\nThe molecule has the following properties:\n\n- 50% of the carbon atoms are chiral\n- $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{O}$\n- $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{N}\\phantom{\\rule{0ex}{0ex}}$ with a random bond.\n- $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{N}\\phantom{\\rule{0ex}{0ex}}$ with a random bond.\n- All carbon atoms are attached to three other carbon atoms.\n\n```\n#\n#  (c) Stefan Wehr.

A set of Java libraries that makes it easy for you to write code to access and manipulate chemical structures in a variety of formats.\n\nTo use the CDK, you must download it using the Maven dependency tool. To check which versions are currently available, visit the CDK project page. We will be using the stable 1.3 release.\n\nThere is a helpful Java tutorial available at the CDK web page.\n\nYour code should consist of only one simple class and a driver. A good way to organize your code for us is to have a single class that implements an interface `GenerateSMILES`. This makes it much easier for us to grade your solution.\n\n#### Sample execution\n\n```\n>java-algs4 GenerateMolecule\nC(N=C(CO)C(c1ccccc1)c1=c2ccccc2)cccn(ccc1=cc1)O\n\n>java-bjuc GenerateMolecule\nC(N=C(CO)C(c1ccccc1)c1=c2ccccc2)cccn(ccc1=cc1)O\n```\n\n#### Tips (optional reading)\n\n- The CDK has many different representations for atoms. You only need to worry about Atom and AtomicNumber in this case.\n- The CDK is designed for handling many different common chemical formats and so has many extra features beyond what you need to complete this problem set.\n\nThere are some examples of code that manipulate molecular graphs using the CDK on the ""Chemistry Algorithms"" page.\n\nIf you read through that code, you will see how you can use `Reaction` to generate new structures similar to the current one by doing different types of transforms that add or remove ""bonds"" from the molecule.\n\nAll this means is you can, in general, add and remove a new atom attached to any other atom, or add and remove a `CCCR` unit attached to any other type of atom, and so on.\n\nAn important note, if you try to have more than 3 atoms on a ring, the atom at the third atom site is not included in the ring, rather it is located on the outer perimeter.\n- There are many types of `Reaction`, but you will only want to focus on those that will generate your molecule. In other words you can ignore all the other reactions. The best way to generate your desired molecule is to start with a very simple structure and incrementally make the structure more complex as you move through the iterations. The final desired structure is shown a few problems from this page. To see this in action, you can copy most of this simple example from our wiki, `CDKExamples` and replace the `Molecule` creation with `Molecule molecule = new Molecule(""NCCN1CCC1"");` You will then need to define your loop that builds up the structure. This is also shown in the problem, `GenerateManyRings.java`\n\n##### Submission\n\nSubmit on Gradescope in the following two steps:\n\nThe first step is you will submit a zipped copy of your entire directory contents, including `README.md`, and an HTML version of all of your Java code.\n\nYour submission should consist of the following four files:\n\n- Your directory (e.g. `public GenerateMolecule-12345_67890123/`)\n- `README.md` (which contains your solution to the reflection problem, along with other comments describing what you submitted)\n- `Graded.java`\n- `Graded.html` (which should build a valid HTML version of your code)\n\nThe second step is that you will paste one of two outputs of your submission.\n\nWe\'ll give you instructions in the Gradescope submission for which output to submit in a few days.\n\nWe will test your program against our testcase which is not available to you.\n\nHere is a sample submission.\n\n#### Grading\n\nThis problem has 3 requirements.\n\n##### Requirement 1: Reflect (10 points)\n\nCreate a reflection of each class you want graded at the end of your directory. A typical entry would look like:\n\n```\npublic class GenerateMolecule {\n\n  /**\n   * Standard boilerplate to', 'You could also generate a molecule with a specified mass and solubility.\nExample\n\n## How to calculate solubility\n\nSolubility is a chemical property and describes how much of a substance will dissolve in a given amount of solid, liquid, or gas solvent. This is a complex process that is influenced by a number of factors. To calculate solubility, we need to take those factors into account and use a formula specific to the situation.\n\n## General\n\n- Solubility calculator\nA general calculator to determine the solubility of a chemical compound without considering a specific solvent or other variables. If your compound is a salt, the calculator will prompt you to enter the corresponding molar masses of all reactants and products, including the water present in the reaction.\n\n## Water\n\n- Calculate the solubility of a salt in water\nA formula to calculate the solubility of a salt in water. To determine how much of the salt will dissolve in a certain amount of water, the solubility formula is used. The amount of salt that will dissolve depends on the temperature of the water.\n\n## Organics\n\n- Convert mass to volume (liquid)\nA mass to volume converter for liquids and solutions. The density of water is 1 kg / liter.

This is a very complex issue, and you can\'t expect chemists who are already challenged with learning the syntax of the other SMILES/SDF and MDL/SDF file formats to remember many more obscure details of SMILES. Also, when you look at this example, it is already too long to be easily memorized.\n\nIt is our position at Cactus Laboratory Software, Inc. that there is a real need for a standard, unambiguous SMILES format for molecules. A standard SMILES would have many advantages: the user would not have to learn the proprietary syntax of each SMILES generator, the software could be written unambiguously and with fewer bugs, it would be easy to parse SMILES strings and check for errors, and of course the users would have to learn a single syntax instead of proprietary syntaxes from many different sources.\n\nAs you may know, this has been an issue for over a decade. There is still no complete standard, but there have been two standards efforts. These are covered in more detail in the documentation for the SMILES tool in The Chemistry Package for Windows.\n\nThe original SMILES standard was the result of an effort by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) in the mid-1980\'s to use the SMILES syntax to store structure information in chemical abstract records (CARS). This resulted in only two standards:\n\n- single letters are used as abbreviations for atoms and rings. Only atoms from elements 6 to 58 are allowed. ""C"" always means carbon. ""R"" always means the rest of the structure. Etc.\n- in order to write groups correctly, parentheses must have the order: open (, close ), group, close (, close )\n\nThis document has some more detail about this syntax. It is based on the syntax used in the SMILES tool in The Chemistry Package.\n\nThere have been two more efforts to develop a standard. The first has been a SMILES definition effort, with many suggestions for standardizing SMILES. This is documented at http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/smiles/index.html. The basic idea is that SMILES syntax is ambiguous and difficult to understand, and therefore SMILES should use only common ASCII characters and a well-defined syntax. This standard is based on the Daylight SMILES format.\n\nThe second effort has been to standardize a more abstract representation for structures called the molecular connectivity table. A group of users of Cactus CARs (a utility for converting CARS files to and from SMILES, SD and SDF formats, and displaying molecules on a PC or in HTML on the Web) have developed many improvements to this format, and called it the Cactus MCT. These suggestions are documented at\n\nhttp://www.molview.org/doc/cactus.mct . This is described in the SMILES tool in The Chemistry Package.\n\nWith the exception of the issue of defining groups, neither of these standards allows much variation in SMILES syntax. In fact, it is probably impossible to produce', ""\nHere's the SMILES for this molecule: C1=CC(=C(C=C1C)O)NC1C(CC(Nc2ccc(-c3cc(-c2cc2)ccc3)cc2)CC(=C1)N1C=C(NC1)O)C=C1 NB If you simply remove all of the labels after C=CC(=C(C=C1C)O) and substitute NN for them, you will not have exactly this molecule, but you will have a molecule with the same skeleton which may be of interest for your own applications\n\nFor this exercise, we are looking for a molecule that has an identical skeleton. The problem is that we need to define the labels that should be on the molecule we want to generate"", '\nTo be able to draw this molecule you simply enter Cc1ccccc1OCC(O)Cn1c(NC2CCCCC2)nc2c1c(=O)[nH] into the structure field below. Now all you need to do is simply right click on the button ""Smiles Draw"" below and choose ""Open in new window"" and the structure will be sent to the Smiles Draw page and it will then be redrawn for you. By the way, don\'t bother if your structure looks the same as in the screenshot above, that was on purpose to make it look as similar as possible to the original molecule.\n\nYou can also see what the molecule look like in 3D by setting the structure field to: Cc1ccccc1OCC (O)Cn1c(NC2CCCCC2)nc2c1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2C and then click on the button ""3D"" below.\n\nThe Smiles Draw page is a handy tool which helps you draw SMILES format molecules. It takes the input from the structure field and it tries to match it to the same chemical functional groups. Then it places each molecule in the correct order so your molecule looks as similar as possible to the original structure in the structure field.\n\nIf you are interested in how Smiles Draw works then you are encouraged to read the description below which describes some of the advanced settings and the structure matching process.\n\n## Matching to a functional group (fragment)\n\nThe process of matching to a functional group works by splitting the structure into functional groups (fragments) and then adding that fragment to the structure field.\n\n### Matching a bond\n\nA bond is simply matched by finding the word or words in the structure field that match the functional group of the bond.\n\n### Matching an aromatic ring\n\nFor example, if the functional group you are looking for is a ring with carbon bonds to it where all the carbon\'s have a double bond to a hydrogen the word we look for is: c1ccccc1 (i.e., the aromatic ring) and not just aromatic ring, or aromatic carbons or aromatic carbon, or even just ring.\n\n### Matching a single functional group\n\nFor example, a single functional group, e.g., S(=O)2(O)C1C(Cl)C(Br)C(F)C(Cl)NCO is matched to the following structure in the structure field: SC(=O)(-Oc1c2ccc(c1-O)c(=O)ClC(Br)C(F)C (Cl)n2)-CC=C1\n\n## Matching functional groups\n\nIn some cases we need to match more than one functional group to ensure the structure is drawn correctly. Take the following structure as an example: FClc1nc2ccccc12C\n\nThe only possible way to draw this molecule is to draw it as if the second c1 was part of a new molecule. If you were to match the c1 by itself to just the ring you would end up with a structure like this: FCC=Cc2ccccc2Cn1c2ccccc1C\n\nThe result of a poor match.\n\nHowever, by matching the c1 to both the ring and then the functional groups on the right of the structure you end up with a correct match of FClc1nc2ccccc12C\n\nThe result of a correct match.\n\n### Matching of a fragment starting at a certain location\n\nSometimes it is necessary to only match a fragment of a large molecule. To find the starting place you need to specify a particular bond as the starting place. If the bond is a carbonyl (C#/O=)-, a carbodiimide (-C(=O)-NHR-), an isocyano (-N#/C=), or a carbene (-C#/) then it will be matched as a complete group at (a) the location of the bond or (b) as close to the location as possible. Otherwise a small fragment of 2 or more bonds starting at that location will be matched as well as possible to the structural fragment.\n\n# The Smiles Draw page\n\nThe Smiles Draw page is used to create and edit SMIFILE format molecules. The Smiles Draw program takes the string input from the structure field and then it tries to draw the best representation of the molecule that matches the structure field.\n\n# Some important notes\n\n- The best way to match molecules is often to split them into various fragments. Sometimes it is also necessary to add more than', ""\n01-02-2007, 01:09 PM\n\n> Originally Posted by Pix\n> Ok.

Now over 10,000 software packages use SMILES for computational chemistry. A SMILES string is a line of text (ASCII), each character in it is an atomic symbol or a special character, thus encoding every molecular feature. The SMILES language comprises 20 special symbols that define bonds, rings, and other features. SMILES text strings that represent molecules are useful for storing, searching, communicating, processing, analyzing, or comparing molecular structure to other structures.\n\nDaylight was founded in 1991 to develop and apply SMILES and related technology to problems in biological and environmental research, and for drug design and development.

The parentheses are included to identify which atoms are bonded together. After you remove the parentheses, you are left with a shorter Smiles string.\n\nThe next step is to replace each atom with its simplest form. This can be done by looking at the periodic table and finding which atoms have the same number of electrons as the original atom.\n\nFinally, you need to convert your simplified Smiles string into a structure. One way to do this is to use a program  that can read Smiles strings.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to go about creating a similar molecule based on a Smiles string, you can always consult a resource like this website.

However, it is important to note that these similarities may only be present in a particular environment or for a particular purpose. The original molecule does not show any molecular similarities when the structure is changed.\n\nOne example of a molecular similarity that could exist when the structure of the original molecule is changed is in the case of a molecule that is a reactant in a reaction. In this case, the similarity would be in the ability of the molecule to react with another molecule in order to produce a product. The similarity would not be present in the case of a molecule that is a product in a reaction, as the molecule would not be able to react with another molecule.\n\n## Can you find a way to link two or more related molecules together and create a sequence of molecules that is similar to the original?\n\nBased on the original molecule in the question, it is not possible to create a sequence of molecules that is similar to the original. The original molecule is a simple organic molecule with no functional groups. In order to create a sequence of molecules that is similar to the original, it would be necessary to add functional groups to the molecule. However, this would change the properties of the molecule and would no longer make it similar to the original.\n\n## Can you modify the molecular structure to create a related molecule with similar properties as the original?\n\nYes, it is possible to modify the molecular structure of the original and create a related molecule with similar properties. The process of making a molecule structurally similar to another molecule is called “functionalization”.\n\nIn order to modify the structure of a molecule, it is first necessary to identify what functional groups are present in the molecule. A functional group is a group of atoms that determines the properties of the molecule, such as its reactivity, solubility, and so on.\n\nThe most common functional groups found in organic molecules are oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon. By knowing which functional groups are present in a molecule, it is possible to determine what changes can be made to create a structurally similar molecule.\n\nOnce the functional groups have been identified, the next step is to determine what changes can be made to these groups in order to create a related molecule with similar properties. For example, if the original molecule is a saturated hydrocarbon, the most basic change that can be made is to substitute one or more hydrogen atoms with either oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.\n\nMolecules with similar properties can also be created by making more complex changes to the functional groups. For example, if the original molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O), it is possible to add an oxygen atom to create an ester linkage (C-O-R where R is an alkyl group). This would change the reactivity of the molecule and make it more similar to the original molecule.\n\nIn short, it is possible to modify the structure of a molecule in order to create a related molecule with similar properties. The process of making these changes is called “functionalization” and it can be done', '\nSimilar Synthesis, or CSS, is designed to create similar compounds based on a seed compound. Users specify the structure of the seed compound by entering a SMILES string. The system builds a similar molecule by altering the functional groups, ring sizes or heterocyclic ring atoms from the structure of seed compound.\n\nMolecules generated as the most similar structure may be based on the Tanimoto similarity coefficient between the SMILES of the seed compound and the compound found most similar in the ChemSpider database. The resulting compounds are shown along with a brief description, and the Tanimoto coefficient.\n\nMolecules generated based on the seed compound without being found most similar in the ChemSpider database may have a structure that was never chemically synthesized. The systems uses a modified version of the Random Forest algorithm to generate these syntheses.\n\nThe Random Forest algorithm is a set of decision trees with a random component. Each decision tree in the forest is built using a subspace of the data. The trees use these subspaces to predict the outcome of the example data points. Each tree is used to make a prediction, and the predictions of individual trees are then averaged.\n\nThe Random Forest algorithm is used to generate similar syntheses. It generates a similar synthesis by randomly choosing one functional group, one bond connectivity, and one ring system. The algorithm chooses possible ring systems based on the seed ring system. The generated syntheses contain the chosen functional group as a functional group, the chosen bond connectivity as one of the bond connectivity choices. Finally, the generated syntheses include the chosen ring system as a ring system.\n\nYou must enter a SMILES string, or submit an RDKit representation. The output is one molecule that is similar to the seed compound. In addition to the output molecule, there is also information about the Tanimoto coefficient and the algorithm used to generate the molecule.\n\nYou must be able to read a SMILES string from files. You must be able to write a SMILES string in different formats from files. You should be able to identify the type of compound generated. You should be able to calculate a set of functional groups for the molecule. You should be able to calculate a set of bond connectivities based on a set of functional groups. You should be able to identify a set of ring systems for the molecule.\n\nYou must be able to interpret the SMILES of a molecule. You must be able to interpret the resulting molecules. You must understand Tanimoto similarity coefficient. You should understand how the Random Forest algorithm is used to generate syntheses.\n\nSimilar Synthesis uses the Tanimoto coefficient to calculate the similarity of one compound to another. The Tanimoto coefficient is a similarity measure that can be calculated using a given set of molecular descriptors or fingerprints. The coefficient can be calculated as:\nTc = 2 × (A intersection B)/(A union B)\n\nThis method identifies compounds that are similar based on atom types and bond types. The result of a similar synthesis is a molecule with a larger set of bond types and atom types. For a given compound, the seed structure, there may not be a similar compound in the database. In cases where the seed compound cannot be found most similar to another molecule, the system uses a modified version of the Random Forest algorithm to generate the synthesis.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nTo use the Similar Synthesis web services, go to this page and click Login to get the access token: http://server.cs.iupui.edu:8080/Similarity/\nIn the “Get the Token” dialog, enter the username and password for a user at Indiana University.

Using the above molecule as a reference structure, what would your new molecule look like?\n\nThe above molecular structure represents a cis-junction of a furan ring fused on to both ends of the phenyl ring. In order to obtain the isomeric molecule I used a SMILES generator on chemspider.org that converts the code using the ‘Smiles’ tab into a 2D representation of the molecule which can be accessed through the ‘Structure’ tab, and finally downloaded as a file which can then be opened using a chemical drawing program.\n\n2. How can you tell this is the new molecule, and not just the original with a renamed R group?\n\nThe difference between the two molecular structures was derived by simply renaming the C=O group to simply O. You can find this by simply going to the structure file on chemspider.org and replacing the group.\n\n3. Do you think this would actually be a valid molecule, or is it just a computer generated joke?\n\nAs aforementioned, I do not think the structure actually exists as it is unstable, it would more likely turn into a molecule similar to 4-vinyl furan.\n\nThe following three diagrams represent my interpretation of an ‘equatorial hydrogen’ molecule. ‘Equatorial Hydrogen’ is a term that indicates that the hydrogen atoms are oriented on one axis of a molecular model. In the below diagrams, I have illustrated a couple different possible models for an ‘equatorial hydrogen’ molecule.\n\n1. Draw at least one model of an equatorial hydrogen molecule. Include the hydrogens and labels explicitly along with a structure diagram.\n\nThe diagram on the left shows the ‘equatorial’ hydrogen atoms as being oriented on one axel of the molecule, whilst the diagram on the right shows the same molecular structure except with the molecule turning to a different angle, with the hydrogen atoms moving from one axel to another\n\n2. Draw at least one model of an anti-equatorial hydrogen molecule. Include the hydrogens and labels explicitly along with a structure diagram and compare your models to each other and to the equatorial hydrogen models.\n\nIn both of the diagrams below, the hydrogen atoms are oriented on the same axis of the molecule.\n\n4. Draw at least one model of an axial hydrogen molecule. Include the hydrogens and labels explicitly along with a structure diagram.\n\nIn the diagram below, a molecule is shown where a hydrogen atom has been removed. When this happens, the remaining hydrogen atoms orient themselves on the second axel of the molecule.\n\n5. Draw at least one model of a pseudo-equatorial hydrogen molecule. Include the hydrogens and labels explicitly along with a structure diagram.\n\nThe below diagram represents a pseudo-equatorial hydrogen molecule as there are actually two axels to the molecule, but the hydrogens are oriented the same way and not along the axis.\n\nThe diagram below represents an ‘axial hydrogens’ molecule that is in a pseud-equatorial position.\n\n1. Draw one structure for a molecule that is possible for each of the ‘equatorial/axial’ situations.\n\nIn the diagram below, we see the hydrogen atoms orientated on the same axel as the molecule. This can be compared to an equatorial hydrogen molecule.\n\n2. If a molecule has 2 different kinds of hydrogens, do you need to worry about both axels in every case?\n\nWhen considering the molecule below, we see both the axels are in exactly the same position. This means that in some cases it may be easier just to represent two axels as one, to make the molecule seem simpler.\n\nIn the diagram below, we see the hydrogen atoms orientated similarly to an axial hydrogen molecule.\n\n3.

It is similar in spirit to the IUPAC line-notation system of notation that is used to describe chemical reactions and the notation used in structural diagrams by chemists.\n\nSMILES are composed of letters, numbers, and standard ASCII symbols that represent atoms, bonds, and other chemical entities.

If you get a Fischer projection where the chain is at an angle, be sure that the atoms shown in the angle are the atoms that are connected to the parent chain.\n\nA Fischer projection, also known as a Newman projection, is a type of non-polar view in organic chemistry that shows the orientation of a group in three dimensions by rotating the structure about a specific central atom and eliminating some bonds to the left and right sides so that all the carbon carbons and hydrogens are in a single plane. A horizontal line drawn perpendicular to the plane represents the front of the chemical structure. The Fischer projection of a compound is an easy manner of representing its 3-D structure on a 2-D page.  The Fischer projection provides a quick visualization of the stereochemistry of the compound by showing you which atom is facing forward (towards you) and which atoms are behind in the structure. The Fischer projection is a way to stereochemically number organic molecules.\n\nConsider the structure shown below\n\nDraw a Fischer projection for this molecule.\n\nSolution\n\nTo draw the Fischer projection for this compound, we have to pick a central carbon atom. In the above compound, we have picked the carbon atom, which is marked in red in the structure. Draw a horizontal line, perpendicular to the structure so that all the bonds behind the chosen atom are not seen anymore. All the unseen bonds can be placed above or below this line.\n\nIn the above example, the molecule does not have two sets of two groups attached to this central carbon atom. There are only two hydrogen atoms attached to this central carbon. So, any of the vertical lines in the above structure are the same at the bottom as well as at the top as is clear from the above diagram.\n\nNow, look at the right side of the central carbon atom. Count the atoms from the top right to see the atoms on the left side of the structure. In the carbon at the top right, count the atoms from the third hydrogen atom to the right and then move leftwards. The order will be\n\nC.H.H\n\nH.H.H\n\nH.H.H\n\nH.H.H\n\nand so on\n\nThus, the structure would be like this in the Fischer projection.\n\nThus, in the molecule above, there is only one carbon atom with two groups and that is the second carbon atom. So, this is considered to be the highest priority carbon atom. This is what is known as the a-carbon atom. This is the central carbon atom in the molecule.\n\nThe Fischer Projection of Stereochemical Numbering is a special type of Fischer Projection. This type of Fischer Projection is most useful when you want to stereochemically number the compound. You may want to know the Carbon Atom, which has the least number of groups attached to it and is called the highest priority Carbon Atom.

There isn't just a single answer for what a new molecule might look like based on this SMILES.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nCore structure can be retained, and two phenyl substituents CCCC can be added.\n\nOr add a hydroxyl group to the core structure through substituents.\n\nOr connect two of the ethyl groups to each other using an sp^{3} hybridized carbonyl group O=C=C.\n\nOr connect a hydrophilic group C=N through substituents to create an amide.\n\nOr add an amino group -NH2 as a substituent to the core structure to form a tertiary amine.\n\nOr connect another substituent on either side of the core structure to create a diamine.\n\nOr add two hydroxyl groups OH or methyl groups CH3 as substituents on either side of the core structure, each connected by a single bond.\n\nOr a cyclic structure can be created by modifying the core structure or through substituents.\n\nA sp3 hybridized carbonyl group O=C=C and a sp3 hybridized amino group -NH2 are added as substituents.\n\nOr add an amino group C=N through substituents to both ends of the molecule to create a secondary amine.\n\nOr connect two ethyl groups to each other with an sp^{3} hybridized carbonyl group O=C=C, and then add an amino group -NH2 as a substituent.\n\nOr substitute an ethyl group with a phenyl group by adding a substituent.\n\nOr add two hydroxyl groups OH or methyl groups CH3 as substituents on either side of the core structure, linked to each other through a sp^{3} hybridized carbonyl group O=C=C.\n\nOr a methyl group CH3 or hydroxyl group OH as substituents, linked to each other on both sides of the core structure through a single bond.\n\n#### Note\n\n1. A new molecule must contain the core structure and the properties of this SMILES string. This is a restriction on the answer to the problem.\n\n2. New molecules can be created by modifying the core structure or by changing the substituents.\n\n3. There is not just a single answer to the problem of what a new molecule derived from this SMILES string might look like."", '\nThis example is based on the tutorial on Fingerprints in the RDKit manual.\n\nThe molecule is an acetylated version of 1,5-anhydrosorbitol. To reproduce the answer to this question exactly, one needs to add a water molecule next to the amide bond. Here is a screenshot of the result.\n\nHere is the code used:\n\n```\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Scaffolds import Scaffolds\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Fingerprints import Fingerprints\n\ndef main(mol):\n    fp = Fingerprints.AtomPairSimilarityFingerprints2()\n    sca = Scaffolds.MolScaffold(fingerprints=fp, maxNodes=4, verbose=False)\n    sc = sca.FromMol(mol)\n    tl = mol.GetSubstructMatches(sc)[0]\n    for m in tl.GetMatches():\n        print m\n    return sc.Smiles()\n\nmol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\'CC2=CC3C4=CC3S=C2C=CC(OC(C)=O)C(COC(C)=O)O4C(=O)N2\')\nmol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n# Chem.DepictMolToFile(mol, ""0.gif"", forceOverwrite=True)  # debug\nprint main(mol)\n```\n\nThe scaffold has a `MaxAtoms == 4`. In other words, it should return 3 (core) rings and the acetylated amide bond (=C-O group). There is no rule that says there must be exactly 3 substructures for the `AtompairSimilarity2` fingerprint; it could be 1, 2 or 3. Let’s run the program.\n\n```\nFJKAAUGVUBS\nBHZMVNQDYH\nC\n```\n\nThere are indeed 3 distinct groups returned. Let’s take a look at the molecule that was generated using the scaffold:\n\nHere is the molecule before (left) and after (right) depiction:', ""\nMy attempts:\n\n`A. [NH]C1=CC(=CC=C1N)C1=CC=C([NH][N])C1=CC=C1`\nB. `[NH]C1=CC(=CC=C1N)C1=CC=C([NH][N])C1=CC=C1`\nC. `[NH]C1=CC(=CC=C1N)CC1=CC=C([NH][N])CC1`\n\nI am supposed to change the `[NH]` to something else\n\nHere's the picture:\n\nComment: What have you tried so far?\n\nComment: I already found a workaround for this using MarvinSketch\n\n## Answer (-1)\n\nIf you don't get any hints as to what the SMILES string should be, just write it like you would write a chemical name, with the abbreviation of every structure part or atom."", '\n## DerivaSMILES\n\nDerivaSMLES is a program that can be used to explore the core properties of a molecule. For example, it can search for related compounds by scanning a large chemical database to find compounds that contain the main features of its structure but that might offer novel advantages. You can use DerivaSMILES at ChemAxon to search SMILES strings.\n\n## DerivaSMILES\n\nWhen you open the derivasmiLES page in ChemAxon, you will be prompted to enter a SMILES string.\n\nClick the SUBMIT button. A new SMILES string will be returned and you can repeat the process as often as you like using the “Continue derivations” link below the results.\n\nNote: If DerivaSMILES is not returning the desired results, please ensure you are using a valid SMILES string. More information can also be found at ChemAxon.\n\n## DerivaSMILES\n\nBelow are some useful hints & tips for getting the most out of DerivaSMILES.\n\n– Try various derivations on similar molecules to find common patterns in the SMILES.\n\n– DerivaSMILES is most efficient when the SMILES string contains a single core with many peripheral groups.']",,,,7,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

Molecular analogues are substances that maintain many chemical likeness with a target molecule and may have physico-chemical and structural similarity or pharmacological properties. Molecular analogues are mainly used for drug discovery programs. If a small molecule is found to be effective as a drug then its chemical space is further explored to discover other analogues with better therapeutic index and potency. Molecular analogues can also be found for a small molecule with many undesirable properties. If a molecule is found to be toxic then its analogues with lesser toxicity are generated and tested for activity. These analogues can eventually lead to the identification of a drug. Molecular analogues can also be generated by molecular libraries of chemical compounds like LeadBuilder at GSK and ChemDiv. These are generated by fragmentation and by the combination of fragments from these libraries.\n\nSmiles strings of molecules can be submitted to generate new molecules that are similar to the input molecules in any of the following ways:\n\n1) By similar number of heavy atoms.\n2) By similar ringsize (atoms in ring).\n3) By substitution with ring sizes of the rings involved and number of heavy atoms in the rings involved.\n4) By substitution with heavy atoms involved.\n5) By addition of rings and heavy atoms.\n6) By deletion of rings and heavy atoms.\n7) By cyclisation with ring sizes of the rings involved and number of heavy atoms in the rings involved.\n8) By cyclisation with heavy atoms involved.\n\n## Output\n\nThe resulting analogues are displayed in the following window for further inspection:"", ""1.

All the others are bonded in the same (or opposite, as for the Sulfur one) direction if there is a plane of symmetry passing through the central atom and a C bond or a R bond. In that case, the other two angles are 120deg. If there is a plane of symmetry passing through the central atom and a C bond or a R bond, then we are not in a substituted radical.\n\nFor the pyramidal radicals, all the single bonds are tetragonal coordination bonds at 109.471612....deg.\n\nFor the trigonal radicals, in general the angles for bonding are about 120.0 deg, but the exact angles depend on the atomic number of the central atom, the other bonds to it and also the length of a bond, if not specified in the string. For C and most other heavies, the valence angle for a single bond tends to be -120. The R bond is at -120 at H, Cl, Br, I, P and As. The B bond is at 124.368703.... at nitrogen. The E/Si bond is at 120.220534.... at nitrogen. Selenium doesn\'t have much of a different ""preference"" in terms of bond angle than sulfur - about the same. B has some different ""preferences"".

The output (at SMARTS level only - structure for similar molecules is output if -s option is provided) is a molecule with one or more atoms changed to make the molecule as close as possible to the SMARTS string.\n. Generate a similar molecule (-s option, eg: 1,3,19,2167 or 3673778) : This generates a molecule by substituting some of the atoms with a random atom. To allow more meaningful search, use -m and -u options to generate different molecules. More than one value may be provided on the command line, or a text file with each value on a separate line (ending in spaces or tabs). If two values are on a line, the first will be used for the first atom, and the second will be used for the second atom. This option selects a random value from the list provided.\n. Randomize atoms in molecule:  -m [2] [atoms in pair] (where 'pair' is two atoms in the molecule being randomized) (default 2)\n  The above option chooses a random atom to substitute, and then selects an atom to substitute the first atom with. This is useful if searching molecules by substructure but where the substructure is not in a specific place in the molecule (ie - not an SMARTS string). The substructure may be on any two atoms in the molecule where at least one is an atom which may be substituted (ie one which is part of a substituent).\n. Optimise the bonds in the substituent in the output molecule: -o (-b provides a simple  optimisation) This option attempts to adjust the bonds in the substituent to make a more reasonable molecule. This option is not really necessary except when you have chosen a bond on an atom at the end of a molecule to be substituted, in which case this option allows the new atom at that place to bond appropriately rather than being isolated. This option can also help when molecules with long side-chains are being randomized by putting all of the atoms which are possible substitutes into the list.\n. Choose a random atom to substitute (either with respect to the complete molecule or with respect to a smaller fragment) : -u [2] [atoms in pair] (where 'pair' is two atoms in the molecule being randomized) (default 2) . To make a substitution more complex, more atoms may be supplied on the command line. For example:\n\n.

It can handle halogen, sulfur, oxygen and various metals.\n. If any oxygen bonds to carbon (either C=O, C-O or CO) the program will not change that atom.\n. It may not always work to change two carbon bonds to hydrogen bonds.  It may fail if the molecule already is in a ring.\n. It is generally good to use this only on relatively small sized molecules.  It may take quite awhile to find a good isomer.  Be patient.\n. This program was written for the Macintosh.  It should work fine with any other UNIX operating system.  It's written in Objective-C.\nA second program will be coming along.   It will generate a 2D or 3D isomera based on a previous one generated with the earlier program.    At this point, it cannot generate a compound that does not exist in the previous compound.\n.\nThe program will create a new SMILES string based on the one provided by the user.     I will create an isomera of that compound first.  For instance, if a SMILES string  (such as c1ccccc1), the program will generate one with a similar structure (such as c1ccc2cn(c3ccccc3)c2c1).   The program will start off with a SMILES string the same as the one provided by the user.\n. It will then attempt to scramble the atoms if there are any single, double, triple or aromatic, carbon-carbon bonds.  Single bond are generally converted to double bonds.  Double carbons are generally converted to triple bonds.  Triple bonds are generally converted to aromatic bonds.   It will also attempt to scramble the atoms if there are oxygen atoms attached to carbon with a carboxylic acid group (CO), a hydroxyl group (OH) or a carbonyl group (O=C).  In general, the program converts single carbon-oxygen bonds to double carbon-oxygen bonds,  Conversely, double carbons are converted to a single carbon-oxygen bonds.  However, if the original molecule contains a lactone, the O oxygen will not be changed. Otherwise, the  oxygen atom may be converted to a carboxylic acid bond.   At any point it will fail a bond and stop.\n. You will have to give the user the program one or two sample input SMILES strings.  It will create an isomera for each one.   The program also generates a list of all the SMILES strings that it has scanned, as well as the program.  For instance, all the strings the program has generated that are 14 characters.   This list will hopefully tell the user when the program fails.  Unfortunately, the program generally will only generate a short list of SMILES strings, since it generally only generates short bonds.  The program may also try to remove a group to see if the molecule is still 10-element.   However, it cannot generate a molecule that is no longer 10-element.\n.   The program has problems if a molecule has a lot of bonded carbons with oxygen.\n. The program takes some time to make a new molecule.  So it can take some time for the user to get the hang of this program.    I would say that the program may take some time  to make the SMILES string, depending upon how large the"", '1-methyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\n\n.

The third number on each line indicates which data set line contains the similar structure. Lines 7, 8 , 9 refer to line 6 of the data set.

This representation will allow us to compute many useful properties of the molecule, ranging from the most complex molecular descriptor used, to simply how to draw the molecule with different levels of detail. When we draw molecules, we can give them a representation that gives us more information about the structure and less about the physical properties of the system. For instance, we can represent a drawing of a carbon with an octet of hydrogen or an alternative representation that contains only skeleton formulas with nothing more than a line representing a single bond. The latter is used mainly to identify more complex structural features to which the previous representation is not conducive. With the SMILES representation we will learn how to use this very efficient tool and how to compute useful physical properties with the use of only a short series of characters or words.\n\nFirst, we will describe atoms by letters in alphabetical order. Carbon and hydrogen are C and H, respectively. These are followed by O, N, and P, respectively. After N, there should be no nonmetal elements that we should find in the structure. If there are some, we will need to use numbers for each of those elements after the nonmetal atoms. For atoms after N, O is followed by S, Cl is followed by Br, I and there is F.\n\nAll of the following atoms are metals and they are given letters in alphabetic order. Hg is first followed by Cu. Ca is one letter behind Cu. Fe is one letter before Zn and Cd. Finally, the letters Al, Si, Pb, In, Sn, Sb, Pt, Zn, and Au finish the list.\n\nWhen bonding atoms we will use ""="" for double bond and ""-"" for one. Triple bonds are denoted as ""=.O"" atoms need the atom before it with the symbol ""@"" and a number "":"" with the valence needed. As such, HF is denoted as F@5:H. For the remaining atoms with elements before N, no hydrogen bonding happens.\n\nBeyond those rules we will follow an order to represent all atoms of the molecule in a string, then the bond that connects the first atom to the second atom, and so on. For bonds, we will place brackets and place each bond inside those brackets. For all elements, we will begin with O and then move on to N, P, and so on. This convention is useful because, if we have to add an atom, as we will see in the exercise below, we do not have to do any computation to find out where we are in this list of atoms, we just keep adding until the number we use matches a position in the element string.\n\nThe first molecule is a simple one. We begin with O and, after this N, then C, H, H, C, and then we finish with C. Note that in the first molecule, we do not use any brackets. This is because each bond is between one atom and another, and therefore, we only need two characters: the first atom (the left one) and the second atom (the right one). After this, you should note that the bond is denoted as ""-"" and that we use the ""@"" symbol to denote hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n\nIn the second molecule, we have the same kind of molecule but with two bonds. We start with a single bond for O and then we add a double bond of C. Note that the second bond is represented by a ""=.O"" notation, or more precisely, it is a double bond with carbon as the left atom and the oxygen atom as the right one. This makes the bracket necessary to show us that the next two atoms (C and C) are joined by a double bond.\n\nIn the third molecule we should have noticed that the molecule is complex and it contains many elements. Note that for the central carbon atom the two bonds are different. A single bond is represented as ""-"" and double bonds by ""=.O"".\n\nFinally, note that in the last molecule we can easily identify as a benzene ring, we do not have to specify the atoms and all we need to know can be represented by a single letter after ""C"": an @.\n\nIn this exercise we learned about the SMILES string representation of molecules. SMILES is a very effective tool that allows simple representation of a molecule as a string of characters, with very explicit rules to define structures. These rules are simple and, with these tools, we can easily represent molecules and their main properties.\n\nIn the next exercises you are given a list of SMILES that are valid, but not complete.

The Cl will be transformed into C while the O atoms will be transformed into H, given that -2 is the charge on the anion. Thus, new structures will be O=C(Cc1Cc2N3C(Cc4C)Cc421)C1.\n\nStep 3:\nAtoms in all molecules are carbon, with the exception of the N atoms in the third molecule (2 are present). These atoms will be turned into C. Thus, the new structures will be O=C([C2]c1cc1)[C2]. The open sites need to be added so a C is added after the C and an O is added after the C2 to produce [NH4=Oc1ccc(C)[O]2]. The template is then O=C([Cc1ccccc1]c2ccc(O)cc2)[NH4=O].\n\nStep 4:\nThe next step is to find out the correct configuration of the ring molecule. The first structure has a hydroxyl group at the third site in the template, but the molecules are inverted compared to eachother. This can happen because there are 3 possible isomers for that hydroxyl group and both orientations are valid. The third structure has 2 possibilities for the same configuration.\n\nStep 5:\nThus the answer is O=C([Cc1ccccc1]c2ccc(O)cc2)[NH4=O] or O=C(CCc1ccccc1)N1CCC(c2n[nH]c(C3CC3)n2)CC1, where the - indicates that this could potentially be a cyclic or acyclic structure, the double bonds could be located anywhere, and the single bond could be between any adjacent atom (but not diagonally between, as these are double bonds).', '\n(o)-CC([O-]ccc[N+]([O-])=O)-C(=C1)[S+]([O-])([O-])=CC(C)c2c[cH]([H])c2c3O(cc1N=C(=NC=CC=C1NC=CC(C(F)=O)CNC(=C3)NC(=N2)CNC)NC2)c3\n\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe commonality between all of these molecules is covalent bonds followed by heteroatom, carbon atom, carbon atom, N bonded to oxygen on other side of that, ending in CO. We have the following common elements:\n\ncarbon\n\nheteroatom\n\ncarbon\n\nO\n\ncarbon\n\ncarbon\n\n\nWe want the central element of a bond sequence to be an atom of lesser atomic number. In our case, that is heteroatom and carbon. We therefore want to place heteroatom into the middle spot.\n\nTherefore, we want to sequence carbon, heteroatom, carbon, O, carbon, carbon.\n\nTo ensure that heteroatom appears in the middle position, we can place any group besides heteroatom into the middle position. In this case, we have placed the group consisting of o=c1oc2ccc(O)CCNCN(c3cc(CF)(Cl)cc3)CCC2 in the middle.\n\nThe hetero atom is then placed on the first position with either F or CF depending on the desired charge of the molecule.\n\nLastly, we have placed the CO group in the last position.']",1.0,1.0,0.5416705030821135,7,3,3,"['\n\nN#C[C@@H](N[C@H](C)O)c1ccccc1', ""\nCCCCN(CCCC)CCCOc1c(OC)cc(-c2cn3cccc(C)c3n2)cc1OC\n\nCODE:\nfrom chem.formats.smiles import Smiles\nfrom chem.format.rxn import Rxn\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Draw\nfrom rdkit.Chem import rdFingerprint\nimport rdkit.Chem.rdmolops as rdops\nimport rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors as rdmd\nfrom chem.io.smiles import (\n  get_mol_from_smiles\n)\n\nfrom chem.smiles import Smiles\nfrom rdkit.Chem import rdchem\n\nsmi_str = '''\nCOc1ccc2[nH]cc(C=C3CN(Cc4ccccc4)CCC3=O)c2c1\nCCCCN(CCCC)CCCOc1c(OC)cc(-c2cn3cccc(C)c3n2)cc1OC\nCCCC(=O)OC1CC2C3(C)CCC(O)C(C)(C)C3CCC2(C)C2(C)CCC(C(C)(O)CCCC(C)(C)O)C12\nCOC12C=CC(CC1)c1c(O)ccc(O)c12\nCOc1ccc(-c2oc3cc(OCCO)cc(O)c3c(=O)c2OC2OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C2O)cc1OC\n'''\n\nsmiles = Smiles(smi_str)\n\nfrom chem.io.smiles import (\n  get_mol_from_smiles\n)\n\nsmiles = get_mol_from_smiles('COc1ccc(-c2oc3cc(OCCO)cc(O)c3c(=O)c2OC2OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C2O)cc1OC')\nm = AllChem.ConvertToSmiles(smiles)\nDraw.MolToMolFile('temp.mol', smiles, useBondOrder=False)"", '\nCCc2cc(O)c3cc(SC(N)c(cccc3C)C(=O)O)c2c4ccccc4']",42.857142857142854,42.857142857142854,5

Don’t respond with anything apart from the SMILES string that encodes the molecule:",,7,"['no header, no comments, no HTML or other formatting and no text other than just the SMILES.\n\nIn the initial test version of the challenge, the molecule should contain no more than 20 atoms, and this number will increase in subsequent rounds of the contest. Also, at least one heavy atom (not carbon) - i.e H, O, N, P, S, P, Cl, Si, Br, I - must be in your molecule,\n\nThe program must also take a SMILES and validate that it is a valid drug-smiles and report an error if it is not!\n\n### Input\n\n- Input is a single string: the SMILES.\n- The input SMILES will contain the following valid drug-smiles characters: `c,n,o,p,a,s,b,f,i,m,h,l,x,u,r,e,j`, `K,Q,V,T,F,Z,R,Y,N,P,L,S,Cl,Br,I`, and also `(,),=,#,$,0-9`.\n- There will be no quotes in the input to ensure that there is a way to ensure the SMILES is a single input,\n- There will be no whitespace, carriage returns or line breaks or other punctuation.\n- There will be no `//` comments in the input.\n- Output formats are described below.\n\n### Valid SMILES\n\n- Any atom in the SMILES must be in order of increasing ASCII index, i.e. `c` < `n` < `o` < `p` < `a` < `s` < `b` < `f` < `i` < `m` < `b` < `n` < `h` < `l` < `x` < `u` < `r` < `q` < `e` < `j` - the ASCII index must be increased by one and any repeated elements should be removed - but not if they are in the same ring system (see below).\n- There can be up to four chiral atoms in the molecule. Any chiral carbon must have a `*` adjacent to it in the SMILES and must not be in a ring system.\n- Any ring must be written as an unambiguous Kekulé (cyclo-notated) SMILES; e.g. `c1ccccc1` is an allowable notation but `c1ccccc`, where carbon is the implicit 1, is not allowable.\n- No 7,8-diazaspiro[4,5]decane rings allowed `c1c2ccccc1ccccc2c5cc(c6cc1cc(c5c6)c2cc5)cc51`\n- One to three ring systems are permitted (the number of carbon in the ring system, counting all rings that are in the ring system, should not be more than 10).\n- Any two ring systems must be allowed in the STEREO APPLETON notation, i.e. use `,` before a ring system and put ring systems in ring systems inside braces,\n- No more that four heavy atoms in a ring.\n- No more than three heavy atoms on the same attached atoms in a chain.\n- `-` should be valid and is used in R-configurational atoms (also see Chiral Atoms below), and also in tautomers,\n- `()` are allowed but only one level of `()` nesting is allowed. For example, `(c1nccc(O)Cl)` is allowed, but `c1nccc(c(O)((Cl))))` is not. `(#b1u)` is allowed,\n- Any number of atoms can be separated by `.`. For example `H_3.N_.CH_3` is allowed but `CH2.N1.CH(CH3)CC` is not (or `.` could be replaced by `->` for a better viewer),\n- The only allowed atoms are `c,n,o,p,a,s,b,f,i,m,h,l,x,u,r,b,q,e,j` and the standard HETATM elements: `V K Q T F M Z R Y S Cl Sb Br I N P`).\n- No two consecutive `f`, `x` and `u` are allowed.\n- All SMILES must start with a letter `c`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `a`, `s`,', 'this ensures that you do not confuse OpenEye with other data.\n\nAs an example, an acceptable response consists of the following entry:\n\n```\n[ ""C3COCCC(C(CC1)C1)CCCC1CC(C(C=O)CC=CC=C1)C(=C)=1C23C/1.CC21OCC(=C)C(=C1)OC(C(CO)C)C1"" ]\n```\n\nIf you just send a smiley face, then that is not a valid SMILES string.\n\nYou cannot add any comments to this entry.\n\n#### Solution\n\nC3CC3C(C(C=O)CC)=C/C=C3[C@H](C)CCC[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C(CO)CC)(O)[C@@H](C(C=O)CC=C3)[C@@H]3O\n\n#### Hint\n\nYou might not have known that was the correct answer!', 'SMILES is all you need to show off your molecular creativity. But what do we mean by valid? Well, think about the validity of what you have done before you start. We are looking for a molecule. This means that it needs to have carbon (c), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). It can also have other elements of course. However at this stage other, more exotic, elements such as boron, sulphur, tellurium can be considered to be exotic and may therefore not pass the validity check. These molecules are valid:\n\nSmiles for valid molecules\n- Boring, trivial valid molecules such as benzene are not acceptable.\n- Molecules with atoms/fragments that may be considered to be too stable or too reactive to be encountered in the real world.\n- Unlikely molecules. For example, molecules with very short bond lengths.\n- Molecules whose stereochemistry cannot always be displayed. An example would be cis-trans stereochemistry.\n- The presence of charges, bonds to metal, or aromatic bonds are also potential reasons for failure.\n- Atoms that cannot be displayed using ACD/Labs SMILES output formats cannot be included. These include some hetero atoms and some elements. Examples of atoms that are not valid in our output formats are boron(B), phosphorous(P), and lanthanum(La).\n\nSo, let your creativity shine through and show us what you can do, without going beyond the validity criteria.', 'if you can’t do that, you haven’t found a valid solution yet.\n\nThe solution might have been inspired by a real drug but don’t use anything that’s on the market or in clinical trials, or anything you think might be found on ChEMBL (a molecule’s being found in ChEMBL doesn’t mean it’s a drug, of course). It’s not easy enough to make up a new SMILES string for an existing molecule — do you want a cheat like that? But go easy on the substitutions, and try using substitutions only from the periodic table in the molecule you’re making up, so it’s not obvious that you’re just building a molecule you saw in ChEMBL in the recent past.\n\nThe molecule ought to have less than ten heavy atoms and less than ten chiral centres, and you might like to consider that it doesn’t have more than one or two rings to start with.\n\nI won’t be posting answers to questions like what’s allowed. I certainly won’t be posting the answer, which you want in SMILES format.\n\nIf you try to use one of the answers from the ChEMBL training exercises, or from the first two weeks’ answers page, or from the answers posted for any of the exercise pages here, you’ll fail because you’re not trying hard enough. You know you’re not trying hard enough if you’re already thinking about using any one of those answers. (There are so many other opportunities to earn a badge over the coming weeks that it’s not worth trying to shortcut, and if the thought of a badge appeals to you, that thought should tell you it’s too early. But for many of you, I suspect you’ll be happy to just do one of the exercises properly, even if you’re not interested in badges.)\n\nAs always, the idea is to work out what to do for yourself — don’t ask me or each other — and when you’re confident you’ve found (or made up) a valid SMILES string, copy the solution to your answer file (which you’ll need for other exercises later, so don’t change it).\n\nYour submission\n\nIf you haven’t yet got your answer file for this exercise but would like to submit an answer, here’s the simplest way:\n\n1. Create a directory named week2_ex3_submissions somewhere on your machine, and go into it.\n2. Create a new file named ‘answer.txt’ and put your text in it.\n3. Move this directory (containing week2_ex3_submissions/ and week2_ex3_submissions/answer.txt) to the same directory where you normally keep your answers, so you’ll be ready for the following exercises.\n\nIf you’ve already got your answer file, here’s the simplest way to check your answer against an answer file that I’ll be using:\n\n1. If you’re in a directory named week2_ex3_submissions (from which you’ll eventually submit your answer), type the command\n`diff your-answerfile my-answerfile`\nto see how your answer differs from my answer.\n\nI might change my mind, but the deadline is Friday 17 June at 23:59.', 'no name, no data, etc.. This is an advanced task, and the code to perform this task is complicated. The challenge code will have been prepared ahead of time. The purpose of the task is to provide an opportunity for those who like challenge tasks to develop their code.\n\nThe code has been prepared, it will be published shortly.\n\nIn order to provide a valid SMILES for a molecule, you must be able to generate a valid MOLFILE for it. Your code needs to perform a valid and complete MOLFILE. To create a valid MOLFILE, you need to provide the SMILES in the form that PubChem requires – a single line without any white space. Your MOLFILE generator may be able to get away with line-breaks inside atoms when they are specified by a ring formula or when the atom has a stereochemical bond.\n\nYou should start with the SMILES of methane (C) as an easy test, then the SMILES of ethane (C2), butane (C4) and pentane (C5) can provide additional test data.\n\nDon’t make your life more complicated than it has to be. Don’t try to use PubChem (or any source) to generate SMILES for your molecules, generating a random molecule is easy. A random molecule is sufficient to solve the challenge; you can get a valid MOLFILE output from all MOLGENS, OpenEye, JChem, OpenBabel, and many others.\n\nThe format of a PubChem SMILES:\n\n- The SMILES can be used with a ring formula (specifying which bonds are stereo with @, @@, and @@@) but no stereo bonds are needed in the format. Ring formulae are an alternative to specifying ring atoms and ring bonds together in []: in this challenge they are not needed, but if you wish, you can generate SMILES with one or the other but not both.\n- To specify whether a single atom may be a stereo atom, you need to use @, @@, @@@. In order to specify a stereo atom, this must be the first thing you output in a particular SMILES string. Any stereo atom must be before ring specifications or any brackets.\n- Any two adjacent atoms separated by a bond can create an aromatic ring if you specify a single pair of @@ symbols between them. In order to specify aromaticity, this must be the first thing you output to specify an aromatic ring system.\n- You may use any combination of @, @@, [, ] and @@ to create aromatic and saturated rings, and you may put any brackets that you like before the @@ that specifies an aromatic ring. If you create a ring, either saturated or aromatic, do not generate any stereo atoms inside this ring.\n- Any stereo atom must appear before any ring formulae, or before any brackets. You must use @, @@, @@@ with an atom name as the first part of a SMILES, then the bond (or bonds) specification (if any), then the other atom. You do not need to specify stereo bonds, but may if you wish.\n- You must provide a valid MOLFILE. Anything other than that makes the submission invalid.\n\nYou can use any SMILES form that PubChem (and other systems) use, but don’t try to use PubChem to create your molecules – generating a random molecule is easy. A random molecule is sufficient to solve the challenge: you can get a valid MOLFILE output from all MOLGENS, OpenEye, JChem, OpenBabel, and many others, using many SMILES inputs. If you want to write your SMILES, use any of the PubChem approved formats, such as:\n\n- SMILES-RDF\n- SMILES\n- SMILES-aromatic\n- SMILES-explicitH\n- SMILES-aromatic-explicitH\n- SMARTS\n- CNF\n- CN2\n- RDF-SMILES-RDF\n\nA useful trick is to create an MDL MOLFILE with a stereo atom, in brackets. Then, replaying using OpenBabel on this file by:\n\n$ obabel file.molfile -O -Ofile_reconstructed.molfile\n\nand then using the file_reconstructed.molfile in the next step to run OpenEye’s OEChem and generate SMILES from the molecule.\n\nMuch of the rest of the', 'that is the point of the question. In chemistry terminology, the molecule must not be one that is present in the National Cancer Institute’s natural product database.\n\nYour solution is likely to fail to meet one of these three requirements:\n\n(1) You will use any molecule for which the chemical representation is in the NCI database. Try finding the right chemical if you have one in mind!\n\n(2) You will generate a chemical representation that is a valid SMILES string but encodes a molecule in the NCI database.\n\nI encourage you to try an online tool called a SMILES generator to get a chemical structure in SMILES string form. You can use the site for free. Search for the tool from an internet search engine.

Select a folder to save the resulting SMILES files. Click the Convert SDF to SMILES button.\n\n## What is meant by SMILES format?\n\nSimple Molecule-Input Line-Entry System\n\nThe Simple Molecule-Input Line-Entry System, or SMARTS, is more general and is used to identify chemical or moiety fragments. An atom, or set of atoms, in a chemical structure is represented by a symbol.\n\n## Does SMILES use MOL file format?\n\nThere are several data formats for storing chemical structure information like MOL format, SMILES format etc. … MOL file format and SMILES file format are used for chemical structure representation. Although, both the files can be used to represent chemical structure but these formats are much different.\n\n## How many characters can SMILES be made up of?\n\nIn other words, SMILES has been extended by adding brackets: [ … ] – to represent a branched molecule.\n…\nSMILES examples.\n\n## What is the file extension for SMILES?\n\nThe SMILES file extension is used for the chemical compounds described by the Simple Molecular-Input Line-Entry System, or by MARVIN, the chemical editor. The file is a string and does not contain binary data, so that it is platform independent.\n\n## What is the mole file format?\n\nMOL file extension is used in molecular visualisation and is the format for describing the molecular structure. MOL files are associated primarily with the MOL Viewer which is an interactive 3D viewer for molecules and a useful tool in molecular biology and chemistry.\n\n## Which of the following molecules is represented by Smiles?\n\nThere is only one way to represent a SMILES string for the benzene molecule and that is: CC(CC)=C(CC)C. A more detailed example that shows both SMILES and InChI strings for a molecule, its name, and its chemical formula may be found here.\n\n## How do you read a SMILES file?\n\nSMILES is not an image! The SMILES format is just a text-based way to store a molecular structure.

In a three-membered saturated ring, the methyl group can be found at either position 3. or 4. In the second case, it must be at the position 2. The RDB file is not needed in the first case, but it contains information on the second case. In a three-membered unsaturated ring, the methyl group must be found in position 3. The RMN file is not needed for this case. The first entry in a three-membered ring needs two entries. The next entry needs only one entry, but it needs to be an aryl group, not a CH3 group. If only one entry is needed, then the other two positions are left to be R. 1. If a ring size is 3, at least one side chain may have to be broken off. 2. In the second ring, at least one side chain must be broken. If necessary the side chain has to be completely rewritten. 3. If a ring size is 3, at least one side chain in ring 2 has to be rewritten. 4. If a ring size is 3, at least one site chain in ring 1 has to be rewritten. 5. If a ring size is 3, at least two sites chains in ring 1 have to be rewritten, but they must have a position at least 2 in order to prevent the formation of cross-bridging. 6. If a ring size is 3, at least three sites chains in ring 2 have to be rewritten but they must not be the same.\n\n## Do my homework for me\n\nAlways include a number with a zero at the end when you want the chemical to be at the site. You do not need to state that you are choosing the site over the other in a ring or a site, but if multiple sites are selected, or if they have a position in a ring, it should be the first one listed. When a ring does not have a position, you do not need to state it at the end. You can leave it out. This is called the “position at end” convention. When a site is selected for the first time, add a single character to the name, but remember that this character also appears in the chemical name of the molecule. For a three- or four-membered ring, there is no need of a character after the “C” of a methyl group at site 1 or 2. An exception occurs if a three-membered ring is followed by a four-membered ring. In this case, the additional character is needed. For example, the “C” in methanol stands for “carbon” because the position of the methyl must be on the third carbon back instead of the fourth. Also when rings are written, it is more complicated when the ring is a three or four member. You will find it easier if you leave out the character. If a ring has more than four members, it must be a four-membered ring. When you want to change a four or a five member chain (a hex or an octa), a number is needed to indicate how many side chains are included in that chain. In other words, if a five member chain contains three side chains, the number “3” should be added. When you change the number, you must add an “X”. For example, if the number “X3” is to mark up that the number 3 of side chains is on the fifth chain and not the fourth, you would use a number “4”. When a five member chain contains six side chains, you would use a number “6” to mark up that it is also on the sixth chain. In other words, you want to indicate that that the number “6” is the number that is the same as the number on either side of the number “4” or side of the number “3”. The number “X” is used in this example, for the same reason: it is used to mark up that the number “6” is the same as the number 1. For every group that is not methanol, the number “X” needs to be added after the group’s name. You can use this number on both sides.\n\n## Do my homework online at cheap price\n\nThis number is also used to mark up the number 1. If you want only one particular group in that group, just put the number “1” on the other side. The number “X” also should be used to mark up that this number is the same as some other number. If a group does not have a side chain, you can use the “Y” instead of the “X”. If you have an atom that is the same as one of its elements, you can use the “O” to mark up that this atom is the', 'N/A  N/A  N/A  SMILES 4820014  CC(=O)CCc1ccccc1CC (=O)cc12c(Nc(=N/)Nc1)c(Nc(=O)/Nc1)O  4821013  CC(=CC=O)C1CCc1cc(O=N/C=C)C  4821017  C=CC(Br)C1Cc1ccc(N)(N)c(NC(=O)C=C(Cl)F)c(O)O  4821053  C(=CC(=CC)C=C)n1c2ncc1[nH]/c34c(NC(=O)Cc3ccc(Fc2cc2)c34)Cl  4822493  C(=O)N1C2=C(=CC(=C)N2)C1  Cc(Br)=CC(N)=C1Cl2c1ccc(N)(N)c3c(NC(=O)C=C(Cl)F)c(O)O  4821015  c1ccccc1[N/C](=[O)/OC(C)=O)C=C(C(Cl)=O)N1  4822491  NCc(Br)c1C1C1=CC(Cl)=C(Cl)C=CC(O)=C1Cl2  C(=C)N1c2c(O)cc(N)c3cc4C(=CC(=CC)C=C)nc(NC(=O)Cc3ccc(N)(N)n4Cl)c2C1  4820016  COC1=CC2=C(O)=C(=O)C1=CC=C(O)=C(O)C(O)C(=O)c1ccc(Br)(N)c2c(Cl)N  4820096  N[C@H]1[C@@H](C(=O)O)CCC1  4820010  NC(Oc3ccc(C(O)OC)cc1)N=C(C(=O)O)C=C1CN  4822498  Nc1c(C)c2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)c(N3)c4c5Nc(Cc4ccc(O)(C)c5CCc1ccc(O)nc2[nH])C  4820071  Nc(C)c1ccncc1N1C(O)O1  4820009  Nc1cc2coc(C)n2c1ccc(Oc(O)OC)n1[nH]  4821052  Nc(=O)Nc1CC(=O)c2ccc3Oc(OC)ccc2c(c3n1c4c5n3n4n5cc2)C  4820040  OC1=CC=C(O)=C(O)C(O)C(=O)c1ccc(Br)c(N)c(C)n2c2[nH]  4820043  O=C(Cc2ccccc2N1C2=NC(C3=CC=C(C3)N1)=O)N=C(C(Br)=O)=O  4820032  O=C(Ccc2n1n2n1O)[nH]/c3cccccccc3Cc4nc(c5)n4cc3OCO  4822434  O=C(C(Oc3ccccc3c1cc1)O)N1C2=NN=C(C(N)Cc2cc1)C=O  4820132  O=C(Cc2ccccc2Nc1cccnc(N)(N)c1c2)N=CN1=Nc(O)=NC1=N  4820051  O=C(Cc1ccccc1CC)=O  4']",,,,7,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

The starting materials can be obtained from the following five compounds:\n1,3-propanal, hexamethylbenzene, ammonia, acetaldehyde and α-hydroxyisobutyric acid.

The topics include computational techniques that lie at the interface of Chemistry, Biology, and Computer Science - topics such as the use of SMILES strings to represent molecular structures, the generation of molecular fingerprints, the identification of chiral centers in a molecular structure, the identification of a molecule\'s tautomeric form, the calculation of a molecule\'s charge, and techniques for the prediction of enzyme specificity. The 20 problems and their solutions cover a wide variety of topics, each of which is presented in just the right amount of detail to provide a level of challenge and complexity appropriate for undergraduate students new to computational methods.\n\nToday, undergraduate curricula at four-year colleges and universities across the country, from small liberal arts colleges to large Research I institutions, include courses in which computational molecular modeling and data analysis play a central role.

If you do not have a licence account, you can still use the Chemistry Cartridge and see how to deploy it in the Getting Started guide).\n- The Chemistry Cartridge needs to be available on the portal homepage with all its contents.', '“4-[6-(2,3,6,7-tetramethyl-2,3,7,8-tetraazatricyclo [3.3.1.1.3,7]dec-6-yl) pyridin-3-yl] quinoline-2,3-dicarboxylic acid” to demonstrate that the SMILES representation produced is a valid and readable IUPAC name.\n\n# SMILES Representations\n\nIt is vital that the SMILES representation that you produce for the molecule is valid, that is not an invalided SMILES and that it can be read by humans to identify the molecule that you have produced. The SMILES strings are usually very long and can be difficult to generate, but it is one of the most important aspects of writing a good computer program capable of dealing with molecules since there is a large amount of data you can retrieve about the molecule after you’ve acquired the SMILES string.\nThere are many ways to write a valid SMILES. The simplest way is usually with a lot of parenthesis, but it may become confusing due to the overuse of it. Below are two examples of valid SMILES.\n\n## SMILES Examples from Open Babel\n\nThe input used is “4-[6-(2,3,6,7-tetramethyl-2,3,7,8-tetraazatricyclo [3.3.1.1.3,7]dec-6-yl) pyridin-3-yl] quinoline-2,3-dicarboxylic acid.”\n\nFrom RDKit:\n\nFrom Open Babel:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you may have picked up, there are many ways that a SMILES can be represented.

Click off the window and the element tool will disappear, but you will need to use it to finish the molecule, so you may as well keep it where it is.\n\nThe next step is to draw the rest of your molecule with the Element and Bond Tool. After drawing your molecule, you can rearrange the elements by clicking and holding on one of the atoms and dragging and releasing it. If you need help aligning the atoms, zoom in. To zoom in or out, you can hold down the Control key on the keyboard and rotate a mouse wheel, or move the mouse horizontally and vertically.\n\nTo add the + charge on the molecule, double-click on the small arrow in the upper right corner of the molecule window.

However, it might not be able to modify the entire structure of the query molecule, leading to a structure that is not very similar to the original one.\n\nThe algorithm is based on the SMILES formula of the molecule that you are asked to modify. To proceed, a new molecule is automatically created from the previous one by modifying a couple of atoms in the formula. Several iterations can be achieved to obtain more variations. If you do not wish to change any specific atom position, you can ask it by simply modifying the atom position to be considered (e.g.: `smiles::add_group_position_modification('[c2]');` will consider only the group starting from `c2` to be changed). Note that the algorithm will only find the most viable solution to each change. Also, if the group that is modified is very large (such as a big ring), the algorithm will likely fail.\n\nThe algorithm only checks bond angles and atomic distances. Therefore, the generated molecules may not be realistic, but they could be suitable for particular purposes.\n\n## Results ð\x9f§ª\n\nWhen executed, `add_group_modification()` creates all the generated molecules and returns the result as a table that includes the original structure, all the generated structures and the number of times the structure has appeared among the whole dataset.\n\nYou can check a particular structure as follows:\n\n```\nmols = smiles::add_group_modification(mol = smiles(smiles, molecule = 1));\nmols\n```\n\n```\nmols(1:3,'smiles')\n```\n\n```\n'CCC1NC[C@]21C(=C)[O-]C(=C)C=C1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'C[C@@H]1[C@]NC(=C)[N-]C(Cl)Cl=C1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'[H]1C[C@@]2CC(Cl)(C(Cl)Cl)C=2C1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'N1C[C@@H]2OC(=C)[O-]C(Cl)Cl[O-]C(=C)C=2C1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'CC1NC(C(C(Cl)(C(Cl)Cl)C(=C)=O)=O)NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'N[C@H]1C(=C)[OC]2OCOC(C(Cl)(C@)Cl)=2C1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n```\n'N1SCC(=C)[O-]C(Cl)Cl[O-]C(=C)C(O)=S1NC=NC=2'\n```\n\n## Tips & Tricks ð\x9f\x92¡\n\nThis algorithm works if a group of atoms (e.g. `NC(<other>)=O)` is indicated.\n\n```\n1.0\n```\n\nAs an example, let's consider a small change to a very known structure:\n\n```\nsmiles::add_group_modification(mol = smiles('COcc[n-]c1cn2ccc3cn(n1)c(C(n2)C(F)F)ccc3n'));\n```\n\nThe algorithm modifiest the group `ccc3` by changing the distance of the last two atoms.\n\n## Troubleshooting ð\x9f\x94§\n\n#### Problem\n\n`smiles` molecule is invalid/unrecognizable.\n\n#### Solution\n\nBefore using `mol`, check that the input is indeed a `smiles`"", '\nAlso, create an input file with the information and an output file showing the results.\n\nMolecular modelling and bioinformatics are two of the most powerful tools used in the pharmaceutical, chemical and biomedical sector for drug discovery, design and development.

The purpose of this project was to generate a more similar molecule from this SMILES string, which was done by converting the benzolium ion to a more complex SMILES string. The SMILES string was then converted into a molecular structure using OpenBabel. OpenBabel. A 6 membered benzolium ion was created as follows: C[C@H]1CCc2c(ccc3c4c(ccc23)C(=O)[C@H](C)CC4)C1=O. This molecular structure was generated by following the OpenBabel tutorial on how to use SMILES in order to generate a corresponding structure. The molecule was then extracted from the SMILES string by using OpenBabel tools to convert the SMILES string into a corresponding MDL SD file. This process allowed me to create a more complex structure, which included the benzolium ion.\n\nThis SMILES string represents a 5-membered pyrrolionine ion: C[C@H]1CCc2c(ccc3c4c(ccc23)C(=O)[C@H](C)CC4)C1=O. The benzolium ion was converted into a more complex structure by substituting the benzolium ion with a more complex structure. I did not have any information on the benzolium ion SMILES string. However, according to the OpenBabel Wiki, it would be possible to extract the SMILES string of any structure from the MDL SD file. Thus, I could have generated a new SMILES string from this MDL SD file.\n\nHowever, since I didn’t have any knowledge about the SMILES string, I decided to generate a new SMILES string from the MDL SD file instead. Firstly, I used the MDL SD file converter to convert a corresponding Open Babel MDL SD file into a molecular data object MDL SD file. The molecular data object MDL SD file was then converted into a molecule data object by using a script. This script converted the SMILES string and the corresponding molecular data object into a molecule data object. The SMILES string was converted into a molecule structure by using Open Babel tools to convert the 5 membered SMILES string into a corresponding molecular structure. The SMILES string was then converted into a molecule structure using OpenBabel tools. To illustrate how this process works, I have generated a 3D rendering of the benz-ring structure on this page: C[C@H]1CCc2c(ccc3c4c(ccc23)C(=O)[C@H](C)CC4)C1=O.', ""\n# similar_molecule_string_based(molecule, max_changes=None, return_iter=False, **kwargs)¶\n\nUsing SMILES of 3 atom and bond strings, you can create molecules similar to the provided molecule. An iterative algorithm is used to find the molecule with the best torsion energy. Max_changes controls the maximum number of changes to the original structure. The algorithm uses rdkit to create possible molecules and then performs a molecular dynamics calculation to determine torsion energy. This function requires an RDkit installed and setup on the system. It also requires access to a DFT or forcefield type of energy method - the current default is uff (UFF) and will need to be installed and setup. See `make_molecule_energy_method`.\n\nThe original molecule structure is retained, and new molecules are iteratively built using a rdkit algorithm. By default, the iterative algorithm will perform 10 iterations per change - the result from each iteration is used to determine the best molecule. The default maximum changes allowed before terminating the algorithm is 2.\n\nThe best generated molecule is returned.\n\nIf return_iter is `True`, the iterative molecule generation steps are returned.\n\nThe resulting SMILES string is returned.\n\nKeyword arguments are passed to the `make_molecule_energy_method` function; which is the backend method for creating molecules.\n\nIn addition, the following arguments are supported:\n\nmax_changes - Maximum change allowed before algorithm terminate. If 0 all changes are allowed. If None (default), 2 changes allowed.\n\nsmiles_count - Number of different smiles to generate in each iteration. If 0 use all possible smiles. If None (default) use all possible smiles.\n\nNote, this function uses a large amount of memory if using the default algorithm.

The goal here is to show that there are several ways to do pretty much everything, and which way you decide is up to the user.\n\nThe example I use here is from a question submitted via an anonymous contact form from our RDKit site http://www.rdkit.org, that basically boils down to: you have some SMILES that you want to compare to other SMILES strings. How might you do it? The SMILES strings are not necessarily in the same format [canonical or non-canonical SMILES]; the same compound is given in non-canonical format three times, and then in canonical format once. The goal is to compare and group all these SMILES strings by their similarity, which of course leads to questions like ‘how do you want to compare?’. Are you counting the number of chemical substructures in the strings that are common? Counting the number of bonds between a collection of atoms? Just the number of atoms that can be matched? Of course the answer is all of these, and probably more. What I present here is my personal method, which is heavily influenced by our own use of RDKit to help find molecules that share common traits as part of the Taverna Prochemics library (more on that later), and I expect you may have some other ideas as well.\n\nMy method starts from the RDKit canonicalization of each string, where I count the number of shared atoms by comparing each canonical string to each other. Of course there are a number of ways to do this that are equally correct, including using one of the many string-matching algorithms. You may want to choose one of the other ways, or perhaps use some combination of other techniques. These data can then be summarized and visualized in a meaningful and useful manner, which for me means creating a matrix of all possible pairings and color-coding them by their (dis)similarity.

In 2D, the SMILES is a linear way of representing a molecule, but it also conveys a great deal of spatial information (for example, how the bonds fall across the molecule), and this information needs to be preserved as we move between 2D and 3D. One option would be to write programs to handle this task using classical approaches to molecular representation: the so-called Lowest Energy Configuration (LEC) representation, and the canonical, enumerated bond representations.\n\nHowever, since 3D is in vivo, and a new set of programs, MIMIC (Molecular Invariant Manipulation for In Silico Chemistry) was made available in 2011^{1}, it would be sensible to use these. This program offers five different representations of a molecule, all with their strengths. The three most obviously useful for this particular challenge are the Bond Sequence (BondSeq), the Fragment Sequence (FragSeq) and the Canonical Atom Sequence (Cass). The Cass provides useful information about molecular connectivity without revealing anything about spatial orientation. The FragSeq has one of the advantages of being unique for any given molecule (if it contains no repeating fragments, an important consideration), and while the BondSeq can actually tell you which is the first and second atoms in a bond, the FragSeq is not as detailed – nor is the BondSeq unique.\n\nFor this challenge, it's the FragSeq that's most appropriate, given that it is chemically meaningful for most organic molecules and it should be unique, but its most valuable property here is the lack of duplicated fragments, since molecules like the SMILES of this challenge contain a lot of duplication of substructure (the two double bond systems, for example) and the FragSeq representation will capture them in a single string (i.e. the duplications won't be repeated).\n\nHowever, this particular SMILES has the disadvantage of having a lot of duplication of substructure within it, which makes its FragSeq representation longer. It's the same issue that was seen with SMILES where sub-structures are repeated. For example, a molecule like (CC1=NN([C@H](C#N)c2ccoc2)[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C1 also has the FragSeq representation (C=CC)=(NCC), which contains the fragment (C=CC). It doesn't matter that the latter fragment is repeated in the SMILES, only the length is important here, and that means that using this FragSeq for this SMILES would be unsatisfactory. Therefore, the following steps will be taken to remove duplicated fragments from the FragSeq:\n\n- First, it is necessary to remove the brackets and parentheses that encase each component of the FragSeq.\n- Next, it is necessary to identify which groups appear as sub-fragments.\n- The final step is remove the sub-fragment (and all of the groups that are connected to it) and replace them with a single group ID (this is important because only then will the groups be unique in the FragSeq).\n\nHaving done that, the resulting FragSeq is: [(C)=(C)(C)(N) (C)(N)=(C)] (which still duplicates fragments (C)), but now the size of the FragSeq is shorter and we can now use the methods and algorithms that are contained in MIMIC to derive a new molecule.\n\nThe way that this problem is solved is to take the FragSeq and walk through it as if it's a stack – the most recently added fragments (groups) are at the bottom of the stack, so the one at the bottom of the stack is removed and then assigned to the left-most atom of the target molecule, while the following fragment groups are then removed (one at a time) and assigned to the subsequent atoms in sequence on the target molecule until the final fragment remaining is the 'root' fragment (which doesn't have any attached atoms) to which nothing can be added, so that remains at the bottom of the stack.\n\nThe molecule shown in the image has the following FragSeq of the groups of atoms that are represented as underlined letters, respectively: [f b i l a c b].\n\nIf this is used in a program that can work through this sequence in the correct order, there are a number of possibilities for making new molecules. The way to do this is a series of simple steps, such that if the FragSeq representation of the SMILES below is changed in any way, then the"", '\n3 Cc2nccn2n1/Soccn1C/NC(=O)[C@H](CO)C2\n\nSolution:\n\nThe core properties of the given SMILES string are that it is a molecule with a carbonyl group, a nitrogen-containing ring, and a chain of carbon atoms (the remaining atoms in the SMILES string are just carbon and hydrogen atoms). The key task in deriving a new molecule that shares these core properties is to maintain the structural elements that are crucial to these properties while making changes to the molecular structure in order to create a new molecule. One way to accomplish this is to identify the key structural features in the SMILES string and then modify them in a way that maintains the required core properties.\n\nIn this case, the important structural elements that we want to preserve are the carbon-carbon chain, the nitrogen-containing ring, and the carbonyl group. One way to do this is to modify the carbonyl group by replacing the carbon atom with a sulfur atom to create a thioester group, while maintaining the core properties of the molecule. The updated SMILES string for this molecule is: Cc2nccn2n1/So/occn1C/NC(=O)[C@@H](CO)C2\n\nThis updated molecule maintains the core properties of the original molecule while incorporating modifications to create a new molecule with additional properties. To visualize the molecule, you can use a molecular modeling or visualization software program.\n\nThe original SMILES string:NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCCN1C(=O)CN1CCN(c2nccs2)CC1 This SMILES string is a linear representation of a molecule in which the atoms are connected by single bonds, and the rings are drawn as cyclic structures, and the connectivity between atoms and rings is indicated by brackets.\n\n### Derive a new molecule that shares core properties with this SMILES string\n\nTo create a new molecule that shares the same core properties as the given SMILES string, we can use the same framework to generate the new molecule.\n\nThis SMILES string is a linear representation of tert-butyl methyl benzyl ether.\n\nTo derive the SMILES string of the molecule, we need to follow a specific format and rules for building the SMILES representation. The SMILES representation of a molecule is a linear text representation that defines the molecular structure from an atom-by-atom basis, starting with the carbon atoms and then the hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe atoms and bonds in the SMILES string are defined as follows:\n\n1. Atom symbols: Each atom in a chemical compound is represented by its element symbol, with the exception that carbon with four bonds is represented by a star character, and carbon with one bond is represented by a dot character.\n2. Bonds: Bonds are represented by a dash character (-), indicating the connection between two atoms. If there is no bond between the atoms in a particular part of the molecule, the dash is omitted from the list.\n3. Ring structure: If a portion of the molecule is structured in a ring, the opening and closing of the ring is indicated by the parentheses ( and ) symbols.\n4. Branches: If a molecule has branches, such as chains or branched rings, they are indicated by the colon ( colon character) followed by the atom label and the number to identify the branch point.\n5. Chiral centers: Chiral centers are indicated by the @ symbol followed by a number representing the chiral center.\n\n### For example, in the given SMILES string NC(=O)[C@@H]1.CCCCN1C(=O)CN1CCN(c2nccs2)CC1, the atoms are represented as follows:\n\nThe first atom in the sequence is nitrogen (N), followed by the double-bonded oxygen (=O), carbon (C), a carbonyl group (-OC), and another carbon (C) linked to the preceding atom by single bond. The following six carbons (C) form the chain structure, which is represented by a loop notation in the SMILES string. The chain is closed by another carbon (C), linked to the preceding atom by a single bond. The next atom after this is nitrogen (N), which is also the chiral center (at the end of the string). The molecule then closes with another chain of the six carbons, linked by single bonds and followed by a single nitrogen atom (N). The final atom in the string']",,,,7,1,0,[],14.285714285714285,0.0

We have here a ring with a double bond in between the nitrogen and an oxygen, and the structure of two carbon atoms attached to two oxygens and two nitrogens. This core becomes our NCCC part in the new molecule.

This means that similar 3D shapes, but different 2D structures can be retrieved.\n\n### Searches\n\n3D similarity searches can be performed on both uploaded files and text-based ligands from the PDB file. You can also use the file selector to choose any file format of interest. Uploaded files are automatically converted to PDB format and the PDB file is searched. To perform a 3D similarity search for a text-based ligand first create a ligand object, see ligands to create it. Then upload the PDB file that contains the ligand.\n\n### Match-sets\n\nThe 3D fingerprinting process that is used to perform the similarity search is rather computationally intensive and so each uploaded file is limited to a maximum size of 1 Mb. The results of the 3D similarity search are returned as matches. Matches are stored in the matchset structure. By default 10 matches are retrieved. If you want to see more that the default 10 matches you can select a different number from the ""Maximum matches"" drop-down menu. You can also remove selected matches by clicking the ""Remove selected matches"" link.\n\n### 3D similarity search example application\n\nTo see example applications of the 3D similarity search, including dock scoring, please see the SIFTS Dock-Scoring Case Study.', '1.

I will ignore the safety margin stuff…\n\nThe second step to know, and this is a huge difference between SMILES reaction and reactions in chemistry textbooks:\n\nIn a textbook you search what you find in the reactants, in the reaction product… In a SMILES reaction you search in the reaction product what is in the reactant…\n\nAs we search in the reaction product what is in the reactant, how can we find what’s in the reactant? That’s not so obvious… The “simple” answer is: do the opposite reaction. There is a not-so-simple thing called the reverse reaction SMILES command.\n\nFor example:\n\n. Generate a reverse: … This is not all: the reverse reaction (or reverse SMILES command) is very useful to find what is in the reactant that the same is also in the reaction product (see next figure). That is extremely useful: we can be sure that in a SMILES reaction that looks like it adds something there is not always something of the reactant. How can you be sure that in a reaction like this: c1ccccc1=ccc2ccccc2(CN)c1n2\n\nthat there is a covalent bond between the nitrogen and the carbon of the ring of the reactant? The two C’s in the same ring are different, so the reaction could be this: COCc1ccc(Cc2ccccc2c3(CNC3)nc2)C(C)(C)OC\n\nIf SMILES would find all the reverse reactions (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t) then we could get: COCc1ccc(c2ccccc2c1)C(C)(C)OC\n\nThis reaction is not the same as the initial one, but we are sure that both will give exactly the same reaction product: COCc1ccc(c2ccccc2c3(Nc3CC3)nc2)C(C)(C)OC\n\nFor SMILES there is something good, bad, and sad: SMILES doesn’t know or doesn’t care about the reversibility of a reaction: COCc1ccc(Cc2ccccc2c3(CNC3)nc2)C(C)(C)OC COCc1ccc(Cc2ccccc2c3(Cc3NC3)nc2)C(C)(C)OC\n\nOne more warning about reverse reactions: be careful about what you are looking at. With\n\nSMILES.Reverse(“COc1ccccc1OC”)\n\nyou will probably get the reaction:\n\nwhich is what you expect. Just one atom of one carbon of c2 changes. But just one atom of one carbon changes in\n\nSMILES.Reverse(“COc1ccnccc(COC#Cc1nncCc(OC)(C)c1)c2n(c3ccccc3)c2”)\n\nYou got it, two atoms! Now let you imagination run, you know that the reverse reaction is a way of finding what is in the reactant … And you should also know that when you look at a SMILES reaction, what you are looking is a “sort of” reverse reaction.\n\nAnd here we are, ready to go ahead!\n\n1st molecule:\n\nwe get as reaction product:\n\n10:CC[C@H](c1c2ncccnc1)C(C)C\n\nthen']",,,,7,0,0,[],0.0,0.0,3

Generate a similar molecule: 5 of each (same as input)\n\nHere are some molecules from a database. I want to select one or a small number of structurally similar compounds for a query. The 'similar' compounds are defined as similar to the query input structure. The input is a SMILES string, as generated by the Open Babel toolkit used by ChemAxe.\n\nThe Open Babel toolkit for generating Fingerprints can be downloaded from here.\n\nThese are FPS (fingerprints) that are computed for each string of molecules. These FPS (fingerprints) consist of bit patterns that act as an identifier or fingerprint for the molecule. There are many types of fingerprints - different types of FPS have different 'properties' - they encode different data - or rather different aspects of data in a molecule. A Fungar Fingerprint is a fingerprint that has fingerprints as bits in the FPS. The example Fungar FPS above contains 4 molecules - with the first 3 being very similar to the query structure and the fourth as different (but structurally similar to the other molecules).\n\nThe fingerprints (fungar fingerprints) above contains 4 molecules - with the first 3 being very similar to the query structure and the fourth as different (but structurally similar to the other molecules). The 4 molecules have FPS identical to the query FPS - 3 of those FPS are identical, and the other, different FPS contains the FPS that is identical to the three other molecules.\n\nNote that the Fungar program can do the computational chemistry by itself, as well as using the Open Babel library. In addition, Fungar provides a high-level scripting interface.\n\nWhat you see is NOT what you get, a 'fungar' fingerprint is only an encoding of a molecule string representation. As such, Fungar can be applied to a database of molecules that is described only by Fungar fingerprints - or by fingerprints from other sources.\n\nThe figure above shows the molecules in a database (in the ChemSpider database) - the molecule on the left in the query - the ones on the left in the selection are similar to that molecule - with the molecule on the right being as different as possible from that molecule - the Fungar score is not necessarily in sync with the chemical similarity. However, the molecule on the right is of similar 'chemical content' as the other molecules (it is also one of my favorite ligand binding receptor molecules).\n\nHere is an example of another fingerprint - the Morgan fingerprint - the molecules in the database are generated with the FPS. Only the R-groups are different:"", '1) pick one of the 3-3D coordinates, 2) generate an isomeric molecule with different stereocenter at this position but otherwise very similar.\n2) Repeat many times in parallel, getting different and uncorrelated new structures.\n\n3) Pick a subset of these new molecules, the best scoring ones, and run their SMILES codes through a SMILES parser as above.\n4) Use this new SMILES parser to select a large set of diverse molecules.\n\nThe problem is that the similarity scoring is not quite optimal, since it does not take into account the stereochemistry of chiral atoms in molecules. The chirality and aromaticity are the source of the most significant descriptors in this problem as far as the scoring of similarity of structures is concerned.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how the ability to generate isomeric (trivial) transformations of a molecule, namely substitution of stereocenters, is very important in the design of methods of data sampling and diversity.\nThe same problem was solved in the first part of the paper (first submission to Arxiv)\n\nThe code is here http://www.molssi.org/~bart/research/smiles2019/smiles_code.py\n\n- Bart Hoogenboom\n\nI am interested in the theory of structure-activity relationship (QSAR and QSPR) and similarity QSAR methods. I have made numerous contributions to the field, from the discovery of the concept of pharmacophore alignment (PharmMap) to methods like EigenValues for QSAR and Tanimoto2D for structure indexes and similarity.\n\nPharmMap is similarity alignment, or pharmacophore alignment, used by a large community for docking and SAR.\n\nEigenValues was the first machine learning method for quantitative structure-activity relations (QSAR) to include QSPR. It uses PLS to analyze the activity of a set of molecules by using the activity itself, combined with some descriptor calculated on these molecules, as the dependent variable.\n\nTanimoto2D is the most complete and sophisticated system of descriptors based on pharmacophore similarity and the Tanimoto function. These are very useful for finding very similar molecules, and also for finding sets of diverse molecules for new drug design and materials development.\n\nA paper is available on my website that illustrates the power of this method.

The cation is at a branching point of the molecule on carbon atoms and is balanced by the two negative hydroxyl or  -OH groups.\n\nThe second and third SMILES strings have the same core structure. This core consists of two carbon atoms attached to Oxygen and the Oxygen carrying a double negative charge because of the two negative and bonded hydroxyl groups. The third SMILES contains chlorine in the ring structure.\n\nThe next SMILES string starts with three consecutive oxygens. There is no core structure this time. Both carbon atoms carry positive charges, one of them is at carbon atom that links the two rings (in the structure) with each other.\n\nThe core structure of the fifth string is the same as in the third one, but this molecule has additional O atoms attached to all four C atoms in one plane.\n\nThe next SMILES string starts with carbon, sulphur and carbon, this time in that order. The core structure is the same as the last one, here we can observe that some hydrogen atoms can be left out and the molecule still makes sense.\n\nThe penultimate SMILES string has a C=O group between two aromatic rings. It has two consecutive fluoride atoms on carbon atoms in one plane, which is why we see numbers after the carbon atom.\n\nThe last SMILES string is interesting in the way it has the C=O (carbonyl) group at the end and contains nitrogen in two rings attached together.\n\nAs you can already see, it is pretty hard to describe the molecular structure of a molecule using plain ASCII  characters and SMILES strings become extremely useful when we need to describe even more complex molecular structures. The next step is to understand what all these characters mean and to learn how to generate them.\n\nWe will start with the following example:\n\n- This is a hydroxymethylmethanol group (OCH2CH2OH). The character R in the SMILES string above is a short notation, which could alternatively be written as:\n- O\n- -\n- (\n- C\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- C\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- O\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n\nIt looks a bit funny with so many brackets, but you get the idea how to translate SMILES strings into simple ASCII. The first three letters mean that we start with an oxygen atom and that the bonding order is 1 (i.e. single bond). The second three letters are used to define the number of bonds the O has attached to C (i.e. 2) and that the bonding order between them is 1 again.\n\nWe come to the second component of the OCH2CH2OH group, which is CH2OH, which has its SMILES string, so we will write:\n\n- (\n- C\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- O\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n- ;\n\nand we glue those two together:\n\n- O\n- -\n- (\n- C\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- O\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- C\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- O\n- )\n- -\n- (\n- H\n- )\n\nThis is the basic building block for us. But what do the letters R and O above mean:\n\n- R\n- : is R-bonding element code,\n- O\n- : is the “order” of the bond\n\nThese two letters define what the next bond will be and what the bonding order will be. We will now look at the most common SMILES codes and show how they can be translated one at a time.\n\nPlease keep the following things in mind:\n\nC and H atoms have only single bonds and are usually not mentioned. C, C# and H have the C and H above the line, which means that these are single bonds. The number that follows is the number of times we have this kind of bonding atoms group in a row. e.g. CCC means that there are at', '0=C(c1ccccn2ccc(-c3ccc4(O)ccc4)c3n2)-ccc1\n\nGenerate an opposite molecule: COc1ccc[C@@H]2sc1(CO)[n-]2\n\nGive a SMILES string of molecule: c1ccsc(C(=O)N)cc1.

Suggest you could use the molecular editor to input the SMILES and create the model, which can then be used (probably) for reactions and SMILES generation. (Although the molecular editor wouldn’t do reactions you could always use its functions to do that; you would have to make sure the reaction could actually occur in reality – i.e. it wouldn’t be a retrosynthesis – to get a valid answer).\n2. There is actually a lot of other software out there (e.g. avogadro, open babel, open eye, gaussview, etc.) and we’ll discuss other software too, which may prove more efficient.\n3.

It is hosted on the Chembl web service as part of the Chembl web services: https://web.chembl.sc/docs/smile-it/\n\nThe SMILE-it Challenge will test your skills, but not your wit. To enter, all you need to do is to create a single new, valid, never seen drug-like molecule in SMILES form; submit it and see how it compares with everyone else.\n\n## Rules\n\nTo compete, all you need to do is send a SMILES request to the SMILE-it Challenge server (details in the submission section below). The system running SMILE-it will check the validity of the SMILES-encoded molecule. If it is valid, it will accept the molecule and the system will return an ID as proof that the molecule is now officially in the system and you can start to compare molecular fingerprints between the molecules that you create, the molecules that other people submit and the molecules in the public compound space (Chembl).\n\nIf you do not submit valid SMILES, e.g. “CC(S(=O)(=O)CCC)=O”, the server may respond with an error message.\n\n## Maps\n\nHere’s 3 maps that shows how your molecules compare with molecules in Chembl, the Chembl data and the molecules that other people have already submitted to SMILE-it.\n\n### The Chembl molecules\n\nA histogram of the molecules SMILE-it has received since it was launched. SMILE-it receives on average ~3 submissions per day. A total of only ~700 SMILES have been submitted in its ~1 year life span.\n\n### Chembl molecule fingerprints\n\nChembl contains 140,962 molecules and ~ 20 million fingerprints. The distribution of the 3 most interesting fingerprints in Chembl. Fingerprints are defined as ECFP-4, CFP-6 and CFP-4 with the radius set to 1 and 2. These fingerprints provide a similarity measure between two molecules. In the first heatmap below is shown how similar each of the molecules in the public Chembl data are with each other. For example, in the top left corner we can see that TOP12322 with the ID `CHEMBL3208361` is most similar to CHEMBL82968. In the second heatmap we see the correlation between each molecule’s fingerprints and the fingerprints of every SMILE-it molecule. This is important because it means that there are ~700 fingerprints associated with the SMILE-it molecules.\n\n### SMILE-it molecule fingerprints\n\nA histogram showing how many different fingerprints were associated with SMILE-it molecules. It is evident that there is high similarity between the molecules that we have submitted (as of Feb 18)\n\n### The ChEMBL SMILE-it molecules\n\nHistogram of the SMILE-it molecules and their similarity with ChEMBL molecules.

Is there a way to quantify how drug-like a molecule is?”\n\nThis is one of the oldest questions in synthetic chemistry!\n\nThe simplest answer to Little Red’s question is: “no” one compound is inherently better than any other (e.g. one doesn’t win an Olympics because it has 110 legs vs. 95 legs). But if you ask the question in terms of practicality, then the answer is not simple and is a matter of opinion. From the pharmaceutical industry point of view, the goal is to find a drug-like molecule that is effective, safe, and easy (cheap) to synthesize. Most molecules are neither drug-like nor synthetically tractable. This means that most molecules are no good! Many compounds, however, even in a drug discovery program, will have an activity profile that makes its chances of being an overall drug slim, but the compound can still be a reasonable test case because it’s druglike and synthetically tractable. As most screening campaigns start with millions of unique molecular structures, all being evaluated for novelty and synthesis, these test cases will make lots of sense to start.\n\nIt is important to understand, however, that the process of designing drug candidates to lead compounds relies on more than just “druglike-ness” and “synthetic tract-ability”. These design elements do not alone tell you why a particular compound failed the drug discovery process. These compound characteristics will always be there, but they aren’t always enough of an indicator. The main problem with evaluating molecules on these factors alone is that people, most drug discovery companies included, make the mistake of assuming that some compounds will be “good”, not being aware of the many other factors that lead to failure. It is not the compound’s fault or the organic chemist’s fault, but other factors such as lack of potency, off-target effects, or the lack of safety profile or PK properties. These issues are the true indicators of a failed lead candidate, but the other “features”, like molecular weight and hydrogen bond donors, were all overlooked!\n\nFrom the blog: “From Pill to Potato, What is drug-like structure?”:\n\n> “Here’s what the term “lead compounds” means in practice. Drug-like structures form the basis and starting point of many drug discovery approaches, and lead-like structures are just a subset of this class. Lead-like compounds are generally defined by various properties that are typical of real drug molecules. These properties are then used by various automated lead discovery programs to help generate a list of promising starting structures for a new project.”\n\nThe following is a description of what we mean when we refer to drug-like molecules. There are two kinds of characteristics of druglike compounds, some that are structural, while others are not, but are still relevant:\n\nStructural Features: Compounds that are druglike tend to contain atoms such as C, O, N, F, Cl, etc. and have very few H, S or P atoms. Typical compounds like C, H, O, N, F, Cl, Br do not tend to have toxic properties (although they can certainly be toxic at high enough doses), but sulfur (in high concentrations) and phosphorous tend to cause irritation, while bromine compounds are toxic because they can displace chlorine compounds in the body.\n\nHydrogen bond donors are another structural feature that tend to increase the drug-likeness of a compound. If you imagine a water molecule with its two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom, the two hydrogens will tend to protrude (slightly), making H-bonding between O-H bonds and other hydrogen bond acceptors more favorable. In other words, if the donor has a strong binding tendency, then that compound will want to interact with other more important molecules in the body. As such, the hydrogen bond donor count should be in the range of 1-3. (You can imagine a water molecule having up to 3 H-bond donations, but we will stop there!)\n\nHydrogen bond acceptors are less important, although they are also present in most druglike molecules. H', '11\n\n## SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification) is a line notation for describing molecular structures and reactions.\n\nThe SMILES language is a free-form variant of chemical notation that allows the chemical names of compound to be written in a linear form. These names describe the structural and physical features of compounds using a minimal set of symbols. These properties include chirality, hydrogen counts, double and quadruple bonds, stereochemistry, charge and radicals. The ability to describe compounds in SMILES notation means that chemical data can be stored compactly in databases, and chemical representations can be shared and exported across different computer programs.', '1) Use the SMILEs of the input to generate a new SMILEs:\n- Delete at least two adjacent non-hydrogen atoms from the input\n- Convert a substituent on a carbon atom to a hydrogen of the same stereochemistry. 2) Do not make a structural change to the resulting SMILEs.\n24 M', '1.\n\n## What are organic molecules?\n\nAn organic molecule is any molecule (i.e, a group of two or more atoms chemically bound to one another) that contains carbon. In many cases, an organic molecule will also contain hydrogen. These are referred to as “organic molecules” because they are most often found in organisms: plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria.\n\n## What can organic molecules interact with?\n\nOrganic chemistry makes things.\n\n## Can organic molecules not interact with water?\n\nCarbohydrates can interact with water and can dissolve in it. Fats do not dissolve in water and are insoluble (cannot dissolve) in water.\n\n## What happens when organic molecules interact with water?\n\nWhen organic molecules are exposed to water, the hydrogen bonds are changed to the stronger hydrogen bonds present in water. When it is exposed to an organic media , the hydrogen bonding is of the weak variety and it cannot form a strong bond and break up.\n\n## Are all organic molecules hydrocarbons?\n\n1 Answer. No, hydrocarbons are a subset of organic molecules. Hydrocarbons are compounds of hydrogen and carbon atoms. So, no.\n\n## What are organic molecules examples?\n\nAn organic compound is a chemical compound which contains carbon and hydrogen atoms. Examples include, hydrocarbons (with only carbon and hydrogen atoms), ethers, hydrocarbon compounds, hydrocarbon esters, and organic molecules (with any molecule containing carbon and any number of other molecules).\n\n## What can organic molecules do?\n\nMolecules containing carbon atoms. This is because they are the building blocks of life – i.e. living organisms such as people, animals, plants and bacteria are made of these molecules. Organic molecules usually have large molecular weight.\n\n## What are biological molecules?\n\nBiological organisms are defined as the living entities of the world (plants, animals, and micro-organisms). Thus, biological molecules are the molecular-level compounds that are found in biological organisms. These compounds are responsible for a vast assortment of biological activity and functions.\n\n## What can organic be called?\n\nThe term “organic” is derived from the Greek word “organic,” which is the word used for an organism’s chemical composition. In this sense, organic is not the same as the word organic. Organic is not the same as non-organic. Rather, the term “organic” can be used to describe a substance that is naturally derived from living organisms.\n\n## What is difference between organic and conventional?\n\nNatural products are made from a living organism whereas synthetics are not. In addition, synthetics have higher concentrations of chemical elements that are not organic. These chemicals are derived from petroleum, natural gas, and coal.\n\n## How do organic molecules contribute to life?\n\nOrganic molecules are responsible for life. They make up 40% of the atoms in the human body and play a vital role in creating, maintaining, and sustaining life.\n\n## What is a good biological molecule?\n\nThe best biological molecule is an amino acid. An amino acid is a very important type of biological molecule. An amino acid forms the building block of a protein. The basic structure of an amino acid is NH2-COOC-R -H. There are about 20 different amino acids in proteins.\n\n## What is a biological molecule for kids?\n\nA biological molecule is a large organic molecule made up of carbon atoms and atoms of other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These molecules are found in the food we eat or may be produced by cells during the process of respiration.\n\n## What are the organic building blocks of life?\n\nCarbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the elements most common in living organisms. The building blocks for life are organic compounds, such as proteins, made up of these elements. Carbon is the element most prevalent in living organisms, where it forms strong bonds. A very long line of carbon atoms make up the backbone of proteins that then form very powerful structures with other, more unstable elements.\n\n## What are these organic molecules used for?\n\nThey are used by all living things on this planet and help in maintaining structure in our bodies.\n\n## Can organic compounds interact with water?\n\nOrganic compounds', '3-amino-2-methyl-3-buten-1-one\n\nWhat is the molar mass of $3-amino-2-methyl-3-buten-1-one$?\n\nMolar mass = $89,98 g/mol$\n\nHow many grams of solvent must you add to make 250 mL of a 25% by wt. aqueous solution of $3-amino-2-methyl-3-buten-1-one$?

GDB13_Random,mistral_base,zero_shot,Produce a SMILES representation for a single novel organic molecule:,,7,"['the structure of the molecule should be a single ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms (in the order C-C-N-C-C); the substituents of carbon and nitrogen should be -CH3 and -H respectively; the ring atoms should be numbered -1, -2, ..., 11 and the -CH3 substituent attached to carbon 7 should be numbered -13.\n\nSMILES is a Linear representation for chemical components that permits the expression of a chemical structure with a list of components, connected through linear bridges to each other. Each component is labeled with a small identifier and then attached to its partners on the left or right side.\n\nA SMILES line is formed by repeating three elemental steps:\n\n- Atom-element declaration. The element declaration is a sequence of atom types. In a single ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms (as requested in Problem definition) the atom types will be Carbon and Nitrogen. For a chain of atoms the sequence could be CCCCCC for a chain of 7 carbons (following some common SMILES representations). This three chars long identifier can be followed by three more chars, which represent the 3D angle between the current atom and its predecessor: e.g. the identifier CCCCCC* represents five attached carbon atoms in a straight line.\n- Stereochemical configuration. The configuration specifies how the substituent atoms are arranged around the parent atoms in space. The three stereochemical configurational declarations are r, l and/or a. When the stereochemical configuration is required the symbol R represents a clockwise configuration, the symbol L represents a counter clockwise configuration, and the symbol A represents an ambiguous configuration (i.e. the atom has no configurational information). When the atom type does not have a configurational information, then the stereochemical sub-statement is absent.\n- Substituent attachment. The statement of attachment of substituents in position indicates the bond order of the covalent linkages. The single character used to indicate the attachment is the dash char ‘-’ .\n\nAtoms are identified in the text by an identifier which is a sequence of digits starting from 1. The connection between atoms is defined by the dash char between atoms identifiers and the order of the dashed pair identifiers: the connection is formed by the atom with less numbered identifier and the atom with most numbered identifier is then connected to the first identifier. The connection between atoms is then indicated by an orientation with respect to its parent atom. The parent orientation can be R/L when stereochemical information is present or it can be omitted. It will always be right for single bonds and left for double and triple bonds.\n\nThe whole statement can be followed by a label, which indicates a unique chemical structure and can be used to represent the structure in a different way. The label starts with a colon and follows a sequence of characters not found in the rest of the statement (including the substituents). In addition, brackets ( ), ( ), { }, { } and [ ] can be found in SMILES statements. They are interpreted as normal characters and they can be present as long as they are not used within the statement to describe chemical structures, which is never the case. A SMILES statement never contains a single slash char ‘/’ ; if it is presented as a statement S and the number of slashes is X, then a new label will be inserted to replace the slash with a sequence of X single dash chars (‘-’). The same substitution is performed if the slashes are followed by square brackets ([ or ]) that, as already mentioned, are not defined within the SMILES line.\n\nIn conclusion, the SMILES notation is a way to describe a chemical structure in a linear fashion and for some atoms it gives information about the bond order (single, double or triple). It does not provide information about the orientation of all atoms within a ring. The SMILES line above the fold for the requested molecule is then:\n\nN1CCCN2CCC3CCC4CCC5CCC6CCC7CCCCCCC(CC7)N3CCC1\n\nIn this line, the label is the single digit 1 in the last position of the string. The whole string, but the last chars, forms the chemical representation of the molecule. An upper number of the number that characterizes a specific atom position within the ring means an orientation towards the left, while a lower number indicates an orientation towards the right.\n\nProblem formulation,\nthe full problem can be found at\nhttps://www.rosettacommons.org/content/user_gu', 'methanol (CH3OH) from the name.

Be sure you understand its basic usage.\n- Write a Makefile for the program which will use `$(MOLECULE)` for the file path of your input file.\n- You can set this value to a different molecule using the Make command `make` where the argument is the path to your SMILES file.\n\nIf you have performed this task correctly, then:\n\n- `smiles-compiler` will generate a SMILES code from the above file.', ""cyclopropylcarbinol\n\n# A. Structure in SMILES\n\nMolecular structures in SMILES code can be represented by an atomic tree structure, see example below:\n\nwhere the lines represent bonds, the dots indicate carbon atoms and the brackets show the molecular structure.\n\nThe structure can be written in a SMILES string like this:\n\nCC[C@]1CC1.\n\nA better notation would be to use single letter atomic names, as follows:\n\nC1CC1.\n\n# B. How to represent a molecule using SMILES\n\nProduce a SMILES representation for a single novel organic molecule: cyclopropylcarbinol\n\nCyclopropylcarbinol is an interesting molecule because it is not planar. Since there are multiple ways a molecule can be drawn, and since most drawings of molecules only represent planar cyclopropene structures (C3CCC3O), we must first consider the various ways it can be drawn, then we need to consider that our drawing can be rotated in the plane into any or all angles.\n\nDrawing the molecule is easy, and the SMILES string should look like this:\n\nC12C1CCCC2CO1\n\nThere are several drawbacks with this SMILES, however, the most obvious one is that two ways of drawing the molecule are used with the same SMILES string.\n\nDrawings of cyclopropylcarbinol\n\nIt might also be of interest to note that it doesn't matter in which way the drawing of this molecule are rotated, as we will see below.\n\n# C. Bond and atom type in SMILES\n\nIn addition to representing the structure by an atomic tree, with the branches indicating the bonds, atoms and bonds can be specified in more detail. The information is usually written in an abbreviated version of the SMILES notation (simply called SMARTS or SMARTS notation), which allows the atom types and connectivity of atoms to be specified. Two simple examples are the aromatic benzene (C1=CC=CC=C1) and the molecule cyclopropene (C=CCCCC<-).\n\nIn more detail, the atom types are defined as follows:\n\nNote that hydrogen is defined and can therefore appear in the SMILES string.\nHowever, if you know that a SMILES string contains only carbon and oxygen and hydrogen, then H does not need to be specified.\n\n## 1. Ring structures can be specified with an atom label\n\nIt is possible to indicate how many atoms of this type there are, using the label on the atom followed by a number in brackets.\n\nThe structure can be represented like this:\n\nC[C@]1C1.\n\nor\n\nC[C],C.\n\nIn this case, the C is the label, @ is the atom type (e.g., aromatic, non-aromatic) and 1 is a label for the number of carbon atoms connected to this carbon atom (in this case two). The latter SMILES representation of cyclopropylcarbinol will be more relevant in our example.\n\n## 2. Atoms and bonds have different types\n\nThe code can also define the type of bond connecting atoms and the atom itself. As an example, consider ethyl acetate. Each carbonyl oxygen is connected to two carbon atoms and these atoms are different (the second carbon atom has three bonds, the first carbon atom only two).\n\nThe code can be written in more detail as follows:\n\nCOC1=C(CO)C(=O)c2ccc2C1=O.\n\nIn this case, the oxygen is sp3 hybridized as well as the second carbon, the first carbon atom is sp2 and the last (C1) is sp2 or sp3, see below.\n\nThe bonds between oxygen and the first carbon atom are single bonds, while the bonds to carbons in the second and fourth positions are both single and double bonds.\n\nMore relevant for our example below, consider cyclopropylcarbinol.\n\nWe know that ethyl acetate has two methyl groups attached to a central oxygen atom, which has in turn has two bonds connected to it, while the methyl groups are single bonded together.\nThis can be represented by the following bond and atom notation:\n\nC(C)/C(=O)O2Cc3cc2ccc32\n\nIt is possible to specify this by giving the type for each bond and atom.\n\nIn this case, the first carbon atom (C"", '9,10-dimethyl-anthra[1,9-cd]anthracene (Dianthracene) according to Rule #32. Follow the procedure in the following steps .\n\n1. Determine the longest contiguous carbon chain. This will be your starting carbon atom (C1). (Note that the longest chain is not necessarily the one with the lowest number.)\n\n2. Count the attached alkyl groups (R). Do not count carboxyl or amino groups as R but COOH and NH2 as R.\n\n3. For each R, count the number of carbons attached to the R that is attached to C1. Begin with the R that is closer to C1. The result will be a set of RN where N is a whole number ranging from 0 to 3.\n\n4. Count all other R in the same fashion but start with the R that is closest to the end of the chain. (Do not count carboxylic acids.)\n\nWrite a SMILES with the following format: C1{RN}, where RN is a complete set of numbers created with the counting from Steps 2 and 3.\n\nPlease only count and report the numbers for RN. All others are automatically incorporated into the format.\n\nExample of Dianthracene\n\n1. The longest carbon chain is C4 – C21. The first carbon of the longest chain is chosen to be C1.\n2. There are four R groups and one carboxylic acid (RCOOH) on this chain. Because of the carboxylic acid, the carboxyl carbon is counted as R. The remaining R groups are counted as alkyl groups.\n3. There are two carbons in the alkyl groups that are attached to C1.\n\nThere are three carbons in the alkyl groups at C16 and C20 that are attached to the R (carboxyl) group on C10.\n\nThere are two carbons in the R group attached to C9.\n\n4. No other R or RCOOH groups on this chain are ignored.\n\nWrite a SMILES with the following format: C1{RN}, where RN is a complete set of numbers created with the counting in Steps 2 and 3.\n\nC1C2=CC\\CC1=C(C\\C(=O)C)c3ccccc3C2=CNC(=O)c5Cc4C(\\CCCC4)N5CCCCC5.\n\nNote: Use the C= in a SMILES to represent a double-bonded carbon when counting the number of carbons attached to an R-group that is attached to an atom earlier in the SMILES molecule. The double bond does not count as a carbon in the R-group counting. (You can check using the C= and C# symbols to represent a double and triple bonds in your drawings, and they will look much like their actual structures.)', ""\n\n1.

In case you don’t know Python, then just go download it from http://python.org/ and read this guide to get started: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/education/catalog.wss/vol_12/section.html?section_id=4089', "", where the atoms C, N, and O have the following properties, respectively: a1=0, b1=6, e1=5, i1=19, d1=2.4, a2=0, b2=39, e2=9, i2=8, d2=0, a3=10, b3=14, e3=0, i3=1, d3=4, where a represents hydrogen-bond donor count, b represents hydrogen-bond acceptor count, e represents topological polar surface area, i represents inverse of molecular weight, d represents molecular weight. For this and all other atoms in the library, e is calculated by counting the atoms in the molecule. I know it is more complicated to calculate it since it requires solvation, but this is not the question here. The molecule in SMILES format, i.e., with hydrogen, must also have the following properties: e = 24, d = 789.2562.\n\nIf you take the molecule as it stands and replace the oxygen with a nitrogen, you get a new molecule that is quite similar to the original, but somewhat smaller. The second and third atoms are essentially identical, but the third is a bit less than the first. The molecule still has a polar surface area of 120.8230Å2.\n\nI also wrote this question in Chemistry Stack Exchange. I was thinking that if there were a program that could generate SMILES similar to the example above, it would be easy to then convert this to SMILES. I tried using chem.lib.Molecule and chem.lib.Property to generate the molecule, but I couldn't get it. I also tried using some of the methods on the API docs, but I couldn't find anything. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.\n\n1\n\nI recently asked a question in Chemistry Stack Exchange (https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10106/is-there-a-way-to-generate-aromatic-rings-in-python-that-look-similar-to-a-m) and I didn't get any help. I've read through PyChemistry and OEChem, which have functions for generating aromatic rings and other molecules, but I didn't find a way to generate a molecule that looks similar to the one in my question. I've also tried to write some Python code to do this, but I'm pretty far from being a Python or Chemistry expert so I think I'm pretty far off.\n\nIt seems this is possible by using something like OpenBabel (I don't know how well OpenBabel works with OEChem; I've only used it with RDKit).\n\nThe only other thing that popped into my head is that maybe someone has already generated similar structures using some chemical software, and they just never bothered to update their code to use the OpenBabel interface.\n\nUpdate\n\nIn Python, you would probably need to start with a small molecule and modify it, but I'm not sure how. For example, you could start with a monomer that is similar to the monomer shown in your post and add hydrogen to the 1 and 2 carbon atoms and then replace the 3 hydrogen atoms with oxygen and then add CH3 groups to the 1 and 2 carbon atoms and then replace the 2 oxygen atom with C3H7.\n\nIn OEChem, you would probably start with the molecule shown in your post and replace the 2 and 4 atoms with the atoms mentioned in your question using the atom-by-atom replacement option.\n\nWhat would you do if you wanted to start with a molecule with some properties in mind and then generate a list of molecule like the library of organic compounds given in the question? You could use the same method on a list of molecules.\n\nThe one way I can think of to solve this is to create a library of molecules that all share the same properties. For example, you could use a molecule with atoms A1, A2, A3, B, C1, C2, D, E, G, and H and modify it to incorporate the atoms from the question.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for how to implement this program, then please let me know. The two key issues I can think of are that it is difficult to write a program that generates molecules and that it is difficult to find a program that generates molecules with the atoms in the desired positions. I'd be more than happy to help with either or both of these"", '. The SMILES representation should use the shortest legal notation. Suggestion: you can write a program to generate, for example, 20 different molecules by randomly choosing elements, atoms and bonds. Then use the software to compare each of these molecules with the molecule given above. Also compare the different possibilities for the number of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms and calculate the percentile difference from the reference molecule. You can generate even more similar molecules using a structure similarity (i.e. fingerprint) search. Compare how different your solution is and compare the similarity with the fingerprint search option.\n\n## Need a custom answer for this question?

If you want, I can improve the parser so that it generates only one output SMILES.\n\nOr if you don\'t need the second output (the one with `4`), you can specify in your pattern:\n\n`CCC1(C2COC2)C(=O)C2CN1(C[2-6])?`\n\nwhich means that the character after `1` can be just from `2` to `6`. There is no need to specify the first `2`: a digit in a pattern automatically means `[1-9]`.\n\nIf you want more flexibility, you can also use `\\d`, as in:\n\n`CCC1(C\\dCOC2)C(=O)C\\dCN1\\d`\n\nwhich selects the first two `2` but the numbers after `CN` and after `C` can be from zero to nine (or just the ones needed).\n\nHope this helps you. Cheers!\n\n### Commented output for SPARC_96794300\n\nThe following is a simple way to generate ""random"" SMILES:\n\n```\nCCN11C1\nNCC11CC\nC1C(N1)CC\n```\n\nIf you look at it, it means: C and N and O are your elements, 1 is a free radical, and `1` or `2` is your R group, all random chosen. For instance, for\n\n```\n1111\n```\n\nit generates:\n\n```\nON11C1\n```\n\nThis means that `ON1` is the first group, `11` is the second group, and `C1` is the third one.\n\nI have added a `-num` flag that specifies this: `-num` specifies the number of elements available, or the number of free radicals you want (if you don\'t need a free radical just set it to zero) and the number of R-type groups you want.\n\nThen you have to specify the ""weight"" of each element and the weight of each group. The weight is the probability of that type of element (or group or free radical) to appear. For instance the weight of C is 1/2 here. Thus, it will be half the time that the element is C. Similarly, we specify that O is CARBOXY is twice C, to have a greater odds for the O atom to get that functionality.\n\nFinally the type of each group is specified, thus, N means NITRO and so on.\n\nAs a general rule, I believe that random generation of R groups is much better than using ""arbitray"" groups like `R`, that might give you problems (I have seen this problem with ACD/Percepta): if you do generate a `R` it has NO SMILES associated to it, so you cannot derive a MDL file (you must manually do it) but using a random pattern will give you, always, an unique group (like NITRO) that you can derive as a MDL file. With random generation, you don\'t need manual derivation of MDL but with a ""arbitray"" `R` you must go to a MDL file and get some `R` and then derive all the remaining files. Then you will get something like:\n\n```\nCCN11CNCC1\nCN11CC11C=O\nC11CC(N1)C1\n```\n\nYou can get, for instance, all nitro derivatives of 2-pyridone:\n\n```\nC11CC(N1)C=C1C11=O\nCN11C=C11=C(N1)C=C1\nC11C(N1)=C=C1C(N1)=C=C1\nCN11C=C11=CC(N1)=C=C1\nCN11C=CN1CC(N1)=C=C1\nC11CC(N1)C=C1O1=C(N1)C=C1\n', '1; however, the C1 must have a different letter and if possible the carbon bonds between C1 and C must have different letters.\nTo further clarify, the bond between C1 and C must have any letter, but not the same letter as the one between the C atom and N. It can be X, H, B, Y, etc. I know that SMILES is not particularly useful for this since it only shows single bonds, but even so, this would make the SMILES better.

The design and development of this project were inspired by the work of https://github.com/peterbeijeren @dragon392 Beijeren on his project https://github.com/peterbeijeren/molecule-queue-example.io Beijeren . Thanks to Beijeren's work, we were able to take their simple example and create a more robust system. Our design decisions were also inspired by the excellent work of @lance-parry @lpparry at Siemens and the work of the team around @jason-ryan @jasonryan at Schrødinger. The initial code and design ideas came from the work of @michaeleick @emichaeleick at Schrødinger as well. The project is open-source and hosted on Github.com (link above). The design makes extensive use of the wonderful JavaScript Cheminformatics library by @mark-kaufmann @mwk17. You can access the repository and raise issues or make PRs over here - https://github.com/rdmq/MoleculeQueueManager.io#readme The design decisions were made with three things in mind: Flexiblity, Security, Speed. The code is organized into a single-page app approach with NodeJS, NPM, Express, React, TypeScript, NXJS, Yarn, and Cheminformatics to make managing and processing molecules simple and quick. You'll need a NoxJS and MoleculeDB database. If that sounds confusing, you can think of a NoxJS as a Docker container that runs inside of your local workstation to manage the molecules and a MoleculeDB as a local database that will handle your RDMQ. Our hope is that users will share their MQDB and MQScripts that other users of this system can use to get an idea on how to generate and filter SMILES. If you have any ideas, feedback, or want to share how you're going to use this project or even contribute, then please do reach out. We will happily include you in our growing list of contributors and thank you! Thank you for reading and please reach out if you have any questions, problems, or need help!

This would be really useful, especially as it seems RDKit support has not been added yet.\nI think the RDKit support is probably coming soonish, though it was never one of the original intentions of the project. What is your intended workflow for processing SMILES with RDKit? Beijeren's original project that we based ours off of never handled the SMILES file creation but let's say for the sake of discussion that what you want is the ability to generate a set of SMILES files for compounds similar to 3-[1,2,3]triazol-5(4H)-one 4-oxide and to then run RDKit on them. The reason that this probably wasn't made by @peterbeijeren @dragon392 @peterbeijeren is that he was most likely interested in just the queue system itself. What you'd do would be to generate the SMILES file using RDKit via something like the OpenEye toolkit. I think Beijeren's implementation didn't have the queue system portion which is a shame. To be honest, there's probably not a lot of interest in the RDKit part of it. That's a shame as it's probably more useful to have the RDKit part included but for now, you can use Beijeren's original implementation and forge ahead with it. To my knowledge, Beijeren didn't ever extend it but to be honest, I'm impressed enough with what he created to not mess too much with it. He's a wonderful developer and if we were able to use his work in this way, he must have thought it would be useful. I'm excited that others think it's useful enough to use themselves!\nMark: I completely agree.

The SMILES string is composed of characters that represent atoms or bond connections.\n\n#### How can I generate molecules from a SMILES?\n\nIn my experience there have been 3 ways to generate a molecule from a SMILES string:\n\n1. Draw molecules and obtain SMILES (which you may or may not know, this is not an option if you are completely inexperienced!)\n2. Create a SMILES using RDKit library\n3. Use machine learning model to predict new molecules based on a SMILES\n\nBelow is the code to create a SMILES using RDKit library:\n\n```\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\n## create a molecule from SMILES string\nmol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\'O=C(O)c2ncc1nnc2CCO\')\n```\n\nUsing RDKit library, I create a mol object with specified smiles.\n\n#### Can I generate molecules without knowing anything or programming experience?\n\nThis is a question that has been on my mind for quite some time. To generate a molecule from a SMILES string, you actually do need some programming experience as RDKit is quite hard to use. You will need the knowledge to create a mol object from SMILES, apply a transformation, and write the smiles string. Also, you need to know to read/write the smiles to/from a mol object. Not only do you need to know all these tasks, but you need to know what libraries to import etc. In my opinion, the easiest way of generating a new molecule is using machine learning model which can generate a new molecules from a SMILES.\n\nHere are the libraries you will need if you want to generate molecules from a SMILES:\n\nTo use machine learning for the purpose of creating similar molecules from a SMILES, you can use either DeepChem, RDKit or MoleculeNet. Personally I prefer using MoleculeNet since all the code is open source. The best way to learn MoleculeNet from scratch is to use my MoleculeNet tutorial.\n\nOnce you are familiar with MoleculeNet, you can use the following script to generate a new molecule and save it (the molecule is saved as a SMILES):\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom deepchem.models import GraphConvolutionModel\nfrom deepchem.datasets import MDDBQMRSplit\nimport h5py\n\nd2vec = h5py.File(""/home/pravin/python/deepchem/data/rdkit_chembl/data/chembl_v24.hdf5"", \'r\')\nembedding_size = 128 # this is the number of features for each atom!\nnum_layers = 6\nntrain, ntest, nval = 14000, 4800, 2242\n# generate a new molecule from a SMILES!\nmol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\'NCC12CC=COC1CC(N)C2N=CNCC2=O\')\nsmile = Chem.MolToSmiles(mol)\ntarget = d2vec[\'labels\'][smile]\n# run some experiments\ngcn_model = GraphConvolutionModel(ntrain=ntrain,nval=nval,n_features=embedding_size,n_convs=num_layers, nout=1, dataset=MDDBQMRSplit(d2vec))\ngcn_model.fit(verbose=0,epochs=50,plot_every_epoch=True)\ns_smiles = gcn_model.predict(smile)\n```\n\nA SMILES string is specified for a molecule which is then used to obtain SMILES. The SMILES string along with a randomly generated target from MDDBQMRS', '.\n\nCC=CC1CC1C1C(N)C=CC1O\nThe SMILES string contains the complete molecular structure. The SMILES string can be used to define the molecule and get to know its properties in several chemical editors, such as ChemDraw, Marvin JS and MOE.\n\nWe will use the Chembench service to create a new molecule. With the example SMILES you provided above, a new molecule will be created and its similarity will be calculated for every existing SDF file. The result is a list of possible and similar molecules. After this phase, you can select one molecule. You’ll find the results page in the following URL: https://api.chemeddl.com/search?smi=CC=CC1CC1C1C(N)C=CC1O', '. See the attached pdf for an explanation.\n\nIf there were no constraints, the code should generate a million similar molecules and display the graphical information with the generated molecules. I\'m having trouble with the syntax for the constraints. Here are some of the errors:\n\n```\nMolecule::isAtomCritical(int) failed with error message:\nInvalid atom type ""F""\nMolecule::isAtomCritical(int) failed with error message:\nInvalid atom type ""F""\nerror:\n1,  1: Error occurred while evaluating expression: (mol.GetAtomWithIdx(2,0)==""F"")\nInvalid atom type ""F""\n```\n\nMy approach was to iterate through each atom in the reference molecule and use the atom number to extract the atom type and assign it\'s molecular formula, but that fails. Do I have the wrong approach to this? Would this problem be easier to solve using the fingerprints generated from CDK? Any recommendations on how to get started with creating the fingerprint?\n\nCode so far:\n\n```\n from rdkit import Chem\n from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors\n from rdkit.Chem import Draw\n import numpy as np\n\n smi = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\'O=CC#Cc1oc(=O)n2c1CCC2\')\n\n for node in smi.GetAtoms():\n  for idx, atom in enumerate(node):\n   val = Chem.ChemicalStructureDescriptor.Atom.GetFormula(node)\n   c_smiles = val\n   print(c_smiles)\n   fm = Chem.FingerprintMols(node=c_smiles) # This is where the code fails\n```', ""where C = Carbon, c = aromatic carbon, N = Nitrogen. The hashed atom between two identical atoms (i.e c1) means 'any atom'. This means you can place ANY atom between the two identical atoms. This is because you can draw:\n\nCc1cccc(C)c1CC#N\n\nAnd you can also draw it with a different atom between the two idental aromatic carbons:\n\nCc1cccc(Cc)c1CC#N\n\nYou can choose what atom to place between C and c1. The aromatic carbon (C) is the base atom (1) . The (C) atom needs a neighbor to bind to and (it cannot be bound to an atom that already exists).\n\nThe N  needs to be covalently bonded to the (C) atom in order to form part of the molecule.\n\nTo avoid confusion, you are asked to put the C atom in the middle, as the center molecule. Everything else must be attached the the C atom. That is, all the bonding between atoms must be between the C atom in the middle and the atoms on the outside.\n\nFor example:\n\nCc1cccc(C)c1CC#C is invalid because it would create a three membered ring.\n\nCc1cccc(C)c1CC#NO is invalid because that would create an illegal bond between the N and C atoms.\n\nThe atoms on the outside are allowed to be in a ring. You can bond to any atom on the outside. It can be either a C atom or the (C) atom. You are ALLOWED to attach H atoms to a carbon atom:\n\nCc1cccc(C)c1CC#CCH3 would be a valid response"", '(=O)OC(=O)\n\nBased on the SMILES string provided, create a similar molecule. Here is the SMILES: C=C1NC=NC(C)C(N(C)C)C1C(=O)OC(=O)\n\nThe final molecule must be submitted in SMILES format. We do not want you to draw a molecule or give any detailed description of it. The only requirement is that it should be similar to the SMILES you were provided.\n\nFor example, if you are provided the SMILES string “CCCC”, you can submit any simple chain of carbon atoms (e.g. “C=CCC=CCC” or “C(C)(C(C))C”).\n\nWhen you are evaluating the similarity, focus on the number and types of atoms, not on the sequence of bonds. So, a molecule containing seven single C-C bonds is similar to a molecule containing six C-C bonds and one double bond. However, a molecule containing two triple bonds can not be similar. Your output can have up to double bonds between carbon atoms. However, if one bond or atom was not mentioned in the original SMILES, you need to add it.\n\nIn this case, we have provided the user with one SMILES:\n\n“CC1C(C(=O)C)NC1=C(NC2=C(C(C)NC2)C)C(=O)OC(=O)”\n\nThe final output molecule may or may not contain every single atom/bond in the above input, but we strongly suggest that the output molecule does not contain any bonds or atom which were not present in the input SMILES.', "". This is isopropyl amino acetate [35354-16-4]. Now do you need to create a molecule that is similar to isopropyl amino acetate? Not really, but this is an exercise to familiarize ourselves with RDKit.\n\n## Creating a Molecule Object\n\nFirst thing that we need to do is import `Molecule` from `RDKit`. This can be done by importing `Molecule` directly\n\n```\nfrom rdkit import rdBase, Chem\n```\n\nThis would be equivalent to\n\n```\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit.Chem  import   Chem\n```\n\nWith `Molecule`, we can get a lot of information from the `Molecule`, such as the SMILES, number of atoms, mass, 3-D coordinates, and so on.\n\nNow we need to define our SMILES\n\n```\nSML =  'CCC12CC(=NNC)C(N1)C2CO'\n```\n\nLet's convert this SMILES into a `Molecule` object\n\n```\nMolec = Chem.MolFromSmiles(SML)\n```\n\nIf this does not work correctly, we can do some troubleshooting and see if there are other ways to get a `MolFromSmiles` object. This is important to know because we would be using `MolToSmiles` as well.\n\n## Some troubleshooting of chemical names\n\nLet's try to do a 3D drawing of this `Molec`\n\n```\nChem.MolDraw2D(Molec)\n```\n\n```\n[\n'2101140103131414101402   N',\n'201114010313141432                 ',\n'110114                               ',\n'121214              C               3',\n'210214031314141402                 ',\n'131214              N               3',\n'110114   C               2',\n'000114                              '\n]\n```\n\n```\n'   [   N                         ]\n   [ :NC=CCC1C=CC=C12                     ]   \n           [ :C(N)C(=O)CC33   ]\n           [                2             ]\n           [C             ]\n....'\n```\n\nLook at the `Chem.MolDraw2D(Molec)` above. Here we want the `N` and the other 3 to be in the same location. The same with the `CO`. We want them to be in a carbon - carbon bond. That is why we used `CO` instead of `CON`.\n\n## Getting The InChi Key\n\nIn this section, we would need to create other Molecules. Thus, we need to be able to store and recall the `Molec`. Let's create a unique way to identify our `Molec`.\n\nTo help us with this, we could use the InChI key. This is a unique way to identify a molecule, such as it's fingerprint. We would like to create a `Molec` and get the `InChiKey`. Then later, we can refer to that `InChiKey` and recall the `Molec` and edit it or change it. This would be useful if we want to do a batch of `Molec`.\n\nTo get the InChiKey, use the `GetMorganFingerprintAsBits(numBits, useChirality,useDegenerateBits)` function. Here are the parameters that are needed to be passed in. The numBits determines the number of bits. The useChirality determines whether is to use chirality or not. To read more about chirality: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2172798/pdf/ccnms00274-0078.pdf. The last parameter is to use degenerate bits or not. In RDKit, we could do some post processing after getting the fingerprint as bits.\n\nAn"", '(=O)O\n\nSMILES strings consist of a combination of letters & numbers, but what do they actually mean? What is the purpose behind them? How can we use them to make new molecules?\n\nThe SIMILES string is a way to represent a unique structure. It encodes the structure as a string made up of letters and numbers that can accurately represent any molecule. The SMILES notation was developed in the early 1980s by Dr. David A. Weininger of G.D. Searle & Company to aid in describing the structures of chemical compounds. It is used across various platforms and software. These include Chemdraw, Jmol, Babel, Open Babel and many more.\n\nThis code is written to generate all possible structures that are encoded in a SMILES string and compare it within the dataset. The code finds the structure-molecule pair having the maximum common atoms and then generates a novel structure based on another molecule in the dataset using the maximum of two substituent groups from the original molecule to the target molecule.\n\nThe novel structures generated by the code can be used to design and create new molecules.\n\nLink to the repository https://github.com/kajol-agrawal/SMILES_code\n\n#### Preferential ordering of antiretroviral drugs based on the genome-wide association studies\n\nThe study focused on the role of host genetic architecture in human responses to antiretroviral therapy\n\n#### Drug repurposing, a promising approach for anti-cancer agents\n\nThe study aims at identifying novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers\n\n#### COVID-19 and Antiviral Drug Prediction using Deep Learning Techniques\n\nThe study is a comprehensive review of different AI techniques for combating diseases like COVID-19, SARS, and MERS']",,,,7,0,0,[],0.0,0.0

You need to know your molecule\'s SMILES code in order to make the 3D structure.\n\nYou may also use ChemDraw to plot your molecule, and then save the generated SDF code in your computer in order to put it in the 3D Molecule generator\'s SMILES form.\n\nTo plot the molecule in ChemDraw, use ""File-Export-Text"" option.', ""=CC1=CCS(=O)(=O)CC(=C)C1C=CC1=CCS(=O)(=O)CC(=C)C1C=CC1=C\n\nFor this problem, it really does matter how you go about the derivatization.

For these problems, we will be using the SMILES format to encode our molecules. In this format, our molecules would be expressed as follows:\n\nCC12CC(C3CN3)CNC(C)(C1)C2\nC#CC1C=CCCOC(=O)N1C=N\nCCOC=C(C)CN1C=NC(C)C1\n\nIn SMILES, every atom is specified as a letter, for example, carbon is C, Nitrogen as N, Oxygen as O, Halogen as X, hydrogen if not specified is assumed to be present, and so on. Bonds are represented as a comma between the adjacent atoms if the bond is a single bond. A period between the atoms means a double bond. A dash means a triple bond. A number before an atom, for example, “C2”, means that at the end of the bond there is a carbon attached to the next two atoms. A parenthesis means a new set of rings, and a backslash is to be used before and after a ring. If a number is to be appended to a ring like “NC1”, this means that there is a Nitrogen and 1 carbon attached at the ring’s end. If you want to have a bond going back to an atom, you just have to put a “#” before the first element. This means that in the first example we have a carbon, a triple bond, a carbon, a single bond to a carbon, and two carbon atoms joined directly. Now you can see how the structure of each molecule is represented by the SMILES notation. You can use the following website to check the SMILES notation of a structure:\n\nIt is important to note that each structure will correspond to a unique structure and will have only one SMILES form and SMILES notation.\n\nAlso, we give 2 examples in the dataset as shown above. The third entry is your desired answer for the first two inputs.\n\nFor each problem, you will need to generate at least 5 unique structures. Each structure will be represented by its SMILES notation.\n\nYou can read about the SMILES notation by reading this paper: 2012 J Chem Inf Model', ""\nO=CC/Cc1cccn1OC2c1=NC(Br)c2=NN/2=C1C\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA simple SMILES generator has been implemented (here). I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader to implement a better one.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nI see you guys are getting frustrated on finding ways to create the answer. This is how I got my final answer.\n\nYou cannot create a new atom in a molecule. However, you need a way to create new branches. So, the idea of getting a branch and adding one more atom to it works.\n\nWe are having a set of 4 molecules. So, basically, we are trying to generate a new molecule having some similarity with those 4 molecules. It is very easy to start. Just get a new branch and attach to an existing atom. The existing molecules may give you some ideas as well.\n\n1. Attaching a new branch to an existing atom:\n\n2. Just copy paste the existing structures one after the other (and you'll see that the atoms remain the same):\n\n3. Now, take the existing molecules and pick a random branch. This branch must have at least one bond with the other atom. And this randomness is very important.\n\n4. Now, take one molecule from the existing ones and paste it in the place of existing atom. This step will create the first branch. You must remember that the atom which has the random branch may act as the root of the tree. So, you'll never attach the random branch to it.\n\n5. Now your main task is to find a way to create new branches. So, you'll pick the remaining molecule as the base of the tree and create another branch (which will be the base of all other branches). Do not copy paste this branch.\n\n6. Take the existing molecules and pick the existing branches. These branches are actually those branches that you need to copy from the existing molecule and add a new atom to those branches. If there are more branches, you'll just add a bond to the new atom and you'll see that it remains as a part of the parent structure.\n\n7. Now, the final part is to connect the branches (which are copied) with the base of the tree. Now you can paste the remaining molecules at the place of an existing atom.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------\n\n- Take the existing molecules (A, B, C, D).\n- Create an atomic structure with the existing atoms.\n- (If there are more than one, take the one which has more bonds.)\n- Choose the one that has the smallest number of bonds.\n- Choose the one whose existing branch has a single atom connected to the existing atom.\n- Create a molecule from the selected branch."", '\nCCC1(C)CC(C(=O)N2CCCC2)CCCN(CCC1)C', '\nThe answer CCC(CC)cc(c1c(cc1)Oc2cnc(c(c3OC3)COC(N)c4Nc2nc3)n)cc2)', '\nO=CC(C)C1O2CC=C1CCCCC(C=O)CC=C1C1C\n\nNotes:\n- Please use a consistent format for your answer.\n- As you can see, there\'s a lot of noise that might be interesting too.\n- This is a hard problem. No need to be ashamed of getting a wrong answer (but I\'ll give you an extra karma if you manage to do it on your\n\nfirst attempt).\n\nGood luck!\n\nSMILES string is a way to describe a molecule. It contains the atoms\' connectivity, number of bonds, and also, you can have stereochemistry information. For example, the molecule that contains ""CC1=NOCOC(CC=CC=O)=C1"" SMILES string:\n\nFor those that you don\'t know the SMILES, here a brief guide:\n\n- The first and second characters are the element (C for element 6 and N for element 7; H, O, N... are usually the first and second element)\n- Singly bonded atoms are usually directly following each other, except for oxygen (O) which is indicated by the \'=\' symbol\n- After the SMILES of each functional group, the sub-groups are given in the order of bonding with the parent.\n- For each atom, the number of bonds it makes with the previous atom is indicated by a sequence of single- and double-bond symbols (for example =C=N, C=C).\n- The sequence is completed by the remaining non-bonding connections of each group of atoms, one at a time, again in the order of increasing distance from the parent core, terminating with all lone pairs - in this case, double lone pairs of the last atoms are shown as (=O), while single lone pairs just use the element symbol (B).\n\nI would really appreciate your upvotes and comments.
