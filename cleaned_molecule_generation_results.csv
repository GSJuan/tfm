But for those not chemists, or those who forgot most of this material the last time around, the best thing to remember is that organic synthesis does not have to be difficult! Organic synthesis is simply a process of making, in a stepwise fashion, a very large number of bonds. We then choose particular methods to make and break these bonds in sequence to produce the final product. In almost every experiment you see in any lab course, you are creating a large number of bonds in one experiment and are limited by our knowledge as to what sequences of reactions can accomplish certain goals. (When looking at any organic synthesis problem, the first step is to think of what general method you might use to make each bond. You can then combine these methods to create your path to the desired target molecule.)\n\nIn this case, the first goal is to take a thioamide and a thioimide as our starting points, and create a five-membered ring from them. This is a common problem: to take two nitrogen-containing species and join them together in a ring with a sulfur atom. This sounds fairly common, and it is, but finding out how to do it is not all that easy. (Finding a way to do this in many synthetic series can be an exercise in itself.) There is one problem that we will encounter and that is how to create the ring from the beginning without having to start with the nitrogens, so that there are no alkyl groups in the way. We will see that this problem is solved in the second answer, but the first is to start with a cyclic sulfamide. In doing so, several problems arise. First, and most obvious, how do we get the cycloalkane? Second, how do we remove the alkyl group from the nitrogen atom? Fortunately both can be done at the same time with an interesting sequence shown below.\n\nThis method of creating the five-membered ring uses the ring-opening reaction of oxazolines with 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene. The first step is just a simple Michael addition of the nitrogen electrophile (nitrile) to an alkene. The second step, which occurs in basic solution, actually forms the ring, along with removing the bromide leaving group (we'll call it a halide to keep it simple). The result is a cycloalkane-substituted sulfamide, and the nitrogen of ring is completely unsubstituted! An even greater benefit is that no alkyl halogens are ever created in the sequence, and an oxygen alkyl halide replaces the halide nitrogen!"", '\n\nC(=O)cc1cc(C(c2ccsc2)C=C(C)N)cc1c(NCCC(=O)C#N)c1', '\nCC(=O)C(C(C(C)C=O)N(CCCC1C2)Sc3cncn3C(CCCC1C2)C)C\n\n## Expert Answer and Explanation\n\nWe need to synthesize a molecule that is new and could potentially fit within this series by observing the SMILES strings given in the question. The strings presented here comprise organic compounds that can be classified mainly into two types: saturated (sp^{3}-hybridized) and unsaturated (sp^{2}/sp-hybridized) systems. The carbon atoms in the saturated compound are bonded to four other atoms, whereas in an unsaturated compound, the atoms are bonded to double or triple bonds.\n\nBy carefully examining the structures, the main similarities that are evident amidst them all lie in the functional groups present in the molecules as well as in the connectivity of the molecules. The compounds, for example; 2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)-1-phenyl-ethanone, 2-methyl-3-(phenylamino)-2-butanone, as well as 4-butylidene-2-cyclohexylmalononitrile are the different functional groups, α, β-unsaturated ketone, amide, and α, β-unsaturated carboxylic acids respectively.\n\nWhile the rest of the molecules, that is, o-chlorobenzyl isothiocyanate, 4-bromobenzyl isothiocyanate, 4-phenyl-2-butanone oxime, 2-methyl-3-((Z)-2-phenylvinyl)benzene-1,4-dione, cyclobutanone, 2-(dimethylamino)-methyl-benzoate, and 2-bromo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone, they all represent benzene rings fused to different organic moieties.\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned points, we can synthesize a new molecule that can potentially fit within this series.

It can form salt with alkali metals. It has a pKa of 13.\n\nMolecule B has no protons, making it a non-protonic acid (also called amphoteric because it can form an unsaturated ionic acid salt as an anion.

Based on the rule of 2, the molecule should have an ionizable -NH/-COOH functional group in addition to the 3 -COOH functional groups. It should also have some hydrophobic functional groups.\n\n## The Task\n\nCreate an equivalent molecule for the provided SMILES with the following features:\n\n- A single -NH2/-COOH group (-COOH functional group can also have the possibility to be the ionizable group)\n- One -COOH functional group can be in this -NH2/-COOH group. (If the -CO and -OH are both in the ionizable group, then they should be separated by the O at the head of the C=O group.)\n- Additional 1, 2, 3, and 4 oxygen atoms and 1, 2, 3, and 4 carbon atoms to help the molecule have more hydrophobicity\n\nThe molecule must also be a real molecule.\n\nThe scoring of the answer is as follows:\n\n## Constraints\n\n### 1. No extra bonds can be added (or removed).\n\nThe molecule must be chemically identical to the original molecule. Here the molecular weight of the molecules is calculated using the atom count, and not the bond count. This allows the algorithm to be robust to errors in the chemical formulas and gives the algorithm more freedom in the creation of the new molecules.\n\nExamples of constraints that are not part of the competition:\n\n- The hydrogen count of the molecule can be increased when using 2 as the default hydrogen count.\n- The atoms are able to be relocated.\n- The atoms have 2 or more hydrogen atoms (this is used to make the relocation less restrictive).\n\n### 2. The molecule does not have to be a unique structure.\n\nThe molecule can be used multiple times, and can also be present in multiple locations in the molecule (this is used for the relocation rule mentioned above).\n\n### 3. The molecule's chemical formula should be balanced.\n\nThe molecule should contain the following elements:\n\n- Oxygen: between 1 and 7 oxygens.\n- Carbon: between 1 and 7 carbons.\n\nThere are no rules for the -O, -N, -S, and -H groups. This is because they can come from the other atoms or can be created from the -NH/-COOH groups.\n\n### 5. All the bond lengths must be between 0.8 and 2.5 angstroms.\n\nThe bond lengths are calculated using the Van der Waals radii, which are available here.\n\n### 6. The molecule does not contain chiral centers.\n\nChiral centers can not be added.

As you probably have seen before, the last answer is the first one written in reverse!\n\nSMILES strings are also mirrored by simply reversing and flipping the SMILES structure around the imaginary plane bisecting the longest chain as a mirror image, just like the SMILES string O`=C/`=O.\n\nMolecules can be symmetrical around at least one axis. Most common symmetric molecule structures are a tetrahedral central atom. A tetrahedral arrangement of four other atoms around the central atom is the most common, not because it is the most stable, but because that is how nature creates chemical bonds. The two most prominent groups of tetrahedral molecules are Carbon Atoms (all four bonding positions filled with Carbon) and Nitrogen Atoms (three of the bonding positions with Hydrogen/Carbon, and the fourth position with just a lone pair). These types of molecules are called tetrahedral-hybrid atoms.\n\nOther examples of tetrahedral and/or symmetrical structures are:\nBuckminster Fullerene and its analogs\nEthylene Glycol\nHydrogen Peroxide\nTraces of other compounds in water\nCyclic structures with double and/or triple bonds\n\nThe most common structure of the hydrogen atom, in both SMILES and 3D space, is the tetrahedral molecular structure. It has two pairs of bonding electrons and two non-bonding electrons. The non-bonding electrons form a circle around the lone bonding Hydrogen.\n\nOne of the most commonly found of these is Hydrogen Peroxide. Hydrogen Peroxide is found in the atmosphere as ozone and also in living tissues, specifically in the cells where it is used to kill bacteria. However, the molecule has a tendency to destroy the cells that it is trying to protect against bacteria. That is why the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in a single cell can only be about 4 ppm or less.\n\nIn addition to Hydrogen Peroxide, other non-bonding electron isomers are also found in both nature and synthesized molecules. These include ammonia, nitrous oxide, and cyanates, all of which have non-bonding electron isomers.\n\nAmmonia, in its most common form, has two non-bonding electrons. However, this is a linear structure. In other forms, however, the molecule has only one non-bonding electron (which in the case of ammonia is the lone electron on the far right side).\n\nIt is interesting to note that the linear form of ammonia, (where only the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms share the two double bonds), is also a molecule with a non-bonding electron isomer. In this molecule, the hydrogen is bonded to the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom, which is why ammonia is sometimes called an oxygen oxide.\n\nAnother interesting example is the non-bonding electron isomer of the organic molecule, malic acid. Malic acid is actually a type of organic acid that can actually be synthetically produced. In the organic syntheses of malic acid, the three double bonds are broken in favor of a single bond. The non-bonding electron isomer is formed in the presence of water because the carbon atom is bonded to the hydrogen that is not bonded to the lone pair on the oxygen.\n\nA third non-bonding electron isomer is found in the molecular structure of the molecule known as the cyano-cyanates. This molecule is one of several organic compounds in which the carbon atoms are all connected by a single bond. The two non-bonding electron isomeric structures are found in the molecule in which the carbon atoms are connected by double bonds. Other types of isomers, such as the cyano-carbonates, have no such electron isomeric structures.', ""\n\nCC1N2C(=O)C(=C1C=C2C1)=O\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nHere we've identified the commonalities among our given SMILES strings above — a central, open chain with an amide, an ether, ammonium, and another amide moiety.\n\nWe'll use this information along with the following steps during our synthesis of a new molecule:\n\n1. Draw a backbone using one of the common moieties from the SMILES strings (i.e., C=O).\n2. Look to the other common features to determine how best to attach the other moieties to the backbone.\n3.

Then, a dendrogram is created that indicates the relationship between the molecules in the group. This algorithm uses a vector of distances instead of a distance matrix. The result is shown here:\n\nThis image creates 3 clusters.\n\n1. Asterisk: Asterisk is a good descriptor of the oxygen functional group.\n\n2. Oxygen-carbon bonds: A two to three bonds indicates the presence of two oxygen to carbon bonds (e.g. in the molecule O=c=nc=cnc1cc2=c3C3CC=C31)\n\n3. Triple bond present: The number of triple bonds is an indicator for the presence of one or more triple bonds.\n\n4. Charge: In the group with the asterisk, the three molecules have charges.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nNext, I used MOLMOTIF to obtain the vector of 1636 bit that characterizes each of the three groups. The resulting bit vectors are shown below:\n\n3 groups\n\nBit vectors correspond from left to right: 7-membered ring, molecule 2, molecule 3\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nAfter solving the first 2 steps in this problem, I solved the same problem with 192 molecules, and I obtained the following similar bit vector patterns. The following table indicates the number of occurrences of the patterns.\n\nThese patterns are very similar to the ones found in the example, and for this analysis I assume that the original examples (the 4 molecules above) and the larger test were generated under the same rules (same conditions).\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nFrom the patterns obtained in the previous step, I synthesize a molecule that could fit in this group. I started by using the grouping rules of step 1 above. Then, I use the pattern with the highest occurrence. The result is shown below:\n\nMy solution for the problem.\n\nIn summary, a molecule of 4 bonds separated from the ring, 2 charges present, two hydrogen atoms, a CCO substructure, and the presence of two aromatic double bonds, could provide a new member of the group.\n\nThis post was created based on a response to a LinkedIn discussion post.
